      "A. The first letter of the alphabet in every known language, the Ethiopie or Abyssinian alone excepted, in which it is the thirteenth. Of the sixteen elementary sounds of the human voice, that which is represented by this initial letter is the simplest, and requires the least exertion of the organs to produce it; for its enunciation is effected by merely opening the mouth, and breathing, so that the air propelled through the glottis may resound audibly in the cavity of the mouth and nostrils. Hence this sound is remarkable for its universality as well as simplicity. Many of the lower animals possess the capacity of uttering it, as every one must be sensible who has attended to their distinguishing cries, in all, or at least in many of which, it may be easily recognised. It is also the basis, so to speak, of vocality; for, on attentive examination, it will be found that the other vowels are little more than labial, lingual, dental, or palatal modifications of this primary, universal, and most elementary sound. It is not without reason therefore that the symbol of this sound is (with one solitary exception) placed at the commencement of every known alphabet. Cicero seems to have disliked the sound of this letter; for in his treatise De Oratore, c. xlix. he denominates it insuavissima littera, probably on account of the out-breathing or expiration necessary to produce the sound of it; but, upon the same principle, the other vowels ought also to have shared his displeasure, seeing that they are merely modifications of this primary στοrχειον or element.\n",
      "In the English language, A is the mark or symbol of three different sounds, termed by grammarians the broad, the open, and the slender; epithets, the two former of which have an immediate reference to organic modification, as well as to the impulse or volume of voice; while the latter seems to apply to the degree of intonation alone. Of these varieties of sound, the first, which resembles that of the German A, occurs in such monosyllables as hall, wall, pall, thrall, where the a is pronounced in the same manner as au in cause; that is, broad and long. The Saxons, it is probable, expressed only this sound of the letter, which is still commonly retained in the north of England, and prevails universally throughout Scotland, the only parts of the island where the genius and idiom of the Saxon language have withstood modern innovations. The open sound of A, again, resembles that of the Italian in adagio and such like words, and is nearly the same with that of a in father, rather, &c. But the slender sound, which is peculiar to the English language alone, is identical with the sound of the French diphthong ai in such words as mais, paix, gai, and is exemplified in hate, late, waste, paste, place, race ; as also in polysyllables, such as toleration, justification, with many others which it is unnecessary to specify. So much for the varieties of this initial sound in English words. A, however, is sometimes employed as an affix in burlesque poetry; in which case it has no other effect than to add a syllable to the line, without any alteration of the sense, just as the vowel or interjection 0 very often does in our old ballads, and in some modern imitations of them. It is also thought to be redundant and insignificative in such words as arise, awake, aright, adoing, agoing. But this seems a mistake; for the ά here used as a prefix, is probably the French abbreviation of the Latin preposition ad; and hence it appears to have an intensive effect, adding to and strengthening the import of the word with which it is combined. In the line, “Arise, awake, or be for ever falľn,” it is evident that the words “arise, awake,” convey a meaning stronger in degree than the simple words rise, wake would have done. The pre-positionary effect in such words as a-doing, a-going, is indeed admitted by grammarians; but, if this be the case, where is the distinction between these instances and a-rise, a-wake, where the prefix is said to be redundant, except that, by usage, it has coalesced in some measure with the word to which it is prefixed? In such compounds as a-foot, asleep, a-week, a-head, a-man, as well as when used before, local surnames, as Cornelius a Lapide, Thomas a Kempis, Thomas a Becket, nobody has ever doubted that the a is a preposition. When a is used as an article, it is merely an abbreviation of the old primary numeral ane, one, and consequently it has no plural signification. Thus a house, a field, a ship, mean one house, one field, one ship; but as it is not one of two, ten, or twenty houses, fields, or ships, but of any number, however great or small, hence it becomes in effect quite general and indefinite, or, in other words, the opposite of the, which defines and limits the attention to something spoken of, pointed out, or referred to.\n",
      "Among the ancients, A was a numeral letter, and stood for 500, and when a dash was placed on the top, thus, Ā, for ten times that number, or 5000. In the Julian calendar[7:2:2] it is the first of the seven Dominical Letters. Long before the establishment of Christianity, it had been in use among the Romans as one of the eight Litterae Nundinales ; and it was in imitation of this usage that the Dominical Letters were first introduced. Among logicians, the letter A is employed as a symbol or sign to denote an universal affirmative, in contradistinction to an universal negative proposition, in conformity with the following, which is the first verse of a well-known distich:\n",
      "Asserit a, negat e, sed universaliter ambae.\n",
      "Thus, the first mode of the first figure, which is a syllogism consisting of three universal affirmative propositions, is said to be a syllogism in Barbara, a word in which the alphas alone are significant, the repetition of that letter thrice denoting so many of the propositions to be affirmative and universal, conformably to the technical classification—\n",
      "Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio, dato primae.\n",
      "In the public assemblies or comitia of the Romans the letter A was used in giving votes or suffrages. When a new law was proposed, each voter received a couple of wooden tallies or ballots, one of them marked vzith a capital A, signifying Antiquo, q. d. antiquam volo ; and the other with U. R., the initials of Uti Pogas. Those who were against the proposed law, (or rogatio, as it was called) threw the former of these into the urn; meaning thereby I antiquate it, I prefer the ancient law, and desire no innovations; while such as were favourable to the bill, as we would call it, threw in the latter, signifying, Be it as you desire, or I vote for the measure you propose. A was also marked on tallies or tablets used in voting in criminal trials, and, standing for Absolvo, denoted acquittal; whence Cicero, in his speech for Milo, denominates it littera salutaris, or the letter of acquittal. We may add, in explanation, that, on criminal trials, three of these tallies or tablets were distributed to each of the judices, or persons constituting the assize, by whom the accused was to be tried; one of them marked with the letter A, absolvo, I acquit; another with the letter C, (littera tristis) condemno, I condemn; and a third with the letters N. L. non liquet, it is not clear. From the number of ballots cast into the urn, those marked with N. L. were deducted, and the praetor or magistratus pronounced sentence of acquittal or condemnation, according as the A’s or the C’s were the more numerous. In cases of equality the prisoner was absolved.\n",
      "In ancient inscriptions, whether on marble, brass, or stone, A stands for Augustus, Augustalis, ager, agit, aiunt, aliquando, antique, assolet, aut; A A for Augusti, Augusta, Aulus Agerius, aes alienum, ante audita, apud agrum, aurum argentum ; A A A for Augusti when they are three in number, and aurum, argentum, oes ; and sometimes its meaning can only be determined by the context of the inscription. Isidore adds, that when this letter occurs after the word miles, a soldier, it denotes him young (miles adolescens). On the reverse of ancient medals, it indicates the place where they were struck, as Argos or Athens; but on coins of a modern date, it is the mark of the city of Paris, probably taken anagramwise from the last letter of the word Lutetia.\n",
      "A, as an abbreviation, is likewise of frequent occurrence in the works of modern authors; as A. D. for anno Domini, A. Μ. for artium magister, anno mundi, &c. The letter α with a line above it thus, a, is used in medical prescriptions for ana, of each; and sometimes it is written thus, a a ; for example, nιel. sacchar, et mann, a vel āa ξj ; that is, take honey, sugar, and manna, of each one ounce. Put to bills of exchange, A is, in England, an abbreviation of accepted, and in France of accepte. It is likewise usual with merchants to mark their sets of books with the letters A, B, C, &c. instead of the ordinary numerals, 1, 2,3, &c. A A A is the chemical abbreviation for amalgama or amalgamation. (a.)\n",

      "AALBORG, one of the four sees (stifts) into which the Danish kingdom, properly so called, to distinguish it from the two provinces of Holstein Sleswick and Lauen-burg, which are a part of Germany, is divided.

The extent is 2902 square miles, or 1,857,280 English acres. The surface is generally level, with on the northern part a succession of lakes, that nearly extend from one side of the province to the other. In the north-cast and east part are some hills, the highest of which attain the height of 1200 feet. The agriculture is in a neglected state, and the manufactures are in a still lower condition. The chief branch of industry is the fishing, especially for herrings, which, when cured, are exported in large quantities. The see is divided into three amts or bailiwicks, comprehending 10 cities, 3 market towns, and 114 parishes. The inhabitants amount to about 124,000: in the year 1814 the births were 2756, and the deaths 1997.

      "AARGAU, or Argovia, one of the cantons of Switzerland. It was originally a part of Berne, but by arrangements begun in 1798, and continued in 1803, it was erected into a separate and independent canton. It is bounded on the north by the river Rhine, which divides it from the duchy of Baden, on the east by Zurich, on the south-east by Zug, on the south by Lucerne, on the south-west by Berne, and on the west by Solothurn and Basle. Its extent is about 600 square miles, and its divisions are into eleven circles, which are again subdivided into forty-eight smaller ones. By the census taken in 1814, the number of inhabitants appeared to be 143,960, and they are supposed to have increased since that period. Then the reformed Protestants were 75,279, and the Catholics 67,000, besides which there were about 1800 Jews.\n",
      "The greater part of the canton is either level or undulating, but some of the mountains on the right bank of the Aar aτe of the height of 2700 feet. The chief river is the Rhine, which forms the boundary, and is navigable, though, on account of shoals and rocks, with difficulty. That river receives into it the water of the Aar, the Wig-ger, the Suren, the Reuss, and the Limmath, as well as that of many smaller brooks and rivulets. The climate is milder than in most parts of Switzerland. In the valley of the Aar figs and almonds ripen, and some wine is produced. The principal occupation is husbandry. The products are corn, wine, and some rape-oil, hemp, flax, potatoes, wood, and turf, and all the common kinds of cattle. Some iron is drawn from the mines by Tegerfel-den. The trade consists in the export of corn and wine, and of some cotton and half-cotton goods, silk ribbons, cutlery, leather, straw hats, and some smaller wares.\n",

The contingent of men for the defence of the confederation is 2410, and of money 48,200 francs. The income of the canton is supposed to amount to 500,000 francs, arising from land, salt, and gun-powder monopoly, tolls, and postage. The expenditure is 10,000 francs less than the income.\n",

The climate is considered to be the best in Jutland. The greater part of the inhabitants are engaged in cultivation, and produce more corn, potatoes, and flax, than their consumption requires, and thus leave a portion for exportation.

      "AARON, high-priest of the Jews, and brother to Moses, was by the father’s side great-grandson, and by the mother’s, grandson of Levi. By God’s command he [7:2:4] met Moses at the foot of Mount Horeb, and they went together into Egypt to deliver the children of Israel. He had a great share in all that Moses did for their deliverance. The Scriptures call him the prophet of Moses, and he acted in that capacity after the Israelites had passed over the Red Sea. He ascended Mount Sinai with two of his sons, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy elders of the people; but neither he nor they went higher than halfway, from whence they saw the glory of God; only Moses and Joshua went to the top, where they stayed forty days. During their absence, Aaron, overcome by the people’s eager entreaties, set up the golden calf, which the Israelites worshipped by his consent. This calf has given rise to various conjectures. Some Rabbis maintain that he did not make the golden calf, but only threw the gold into the fire, to get rid of the importunities of the people; and that certain magicians who mingled with the Israelites at their departure from Egypt, cast this gold into the figure of a calf. According to some authors, the fear of falling a sacrifice to the resentment of the people, by giving a refusal, made Aaron comply with their desire: and they allege also, that he hoped to elude their request, by demanding of the women to contribute their ear-rings; imagining they would rather choose to remain without a visible deity, than be deprived of their personal ornaments. This affair of the golden calf happened in the third month after the Israelites came out of Egypt. In the first month of the following year, Aaron was appointed by God high-priest; which office he executed during the time that the children of Israel continued in the wilderness. He died upon Mount Hor, in the fortieth year after the departure from Egypt, being then 123 years old; a. Μ. 2522, of the Julian period 3262, before the Christian era 1452.\n",

      "AARSENS, Francis, Lord of Someldyck and Spyck, one of the greatest negotiators of the United Provinces. He was born at the Hague in 1572. His father, Cornelius Aarsens, was secretary to the States; and being acquainted with Mr Mornay du Plessis, at the court of William prince of Orange, he prevailed upon him to take his son under him, with whom he continued some years. John Olden Barneveldt, who presided over the affairs of Holland and all the United Provinces, sent him afterwards as resident into France, where he learned to negotiate under those profound politicians Henry IV., Villeroy, Jeanin, & c . Soon after, he was invested with the character of ambassador, and was the first who was recognised as such by the French court., He resided in France 15 years; during which time he received great marks of esteem from the king, who created him a knight and baron; and for this reason he was received among the nobles of the province of Holland. However, he became at length so odious to the French court, that they desired to have him recalled. He was afterwards deputed to Venice, and to several German and Italian princes, upon occasion of the troubles in Bohemia. He was the first of three extraordinary ambassadors sent to England in 1620, and the second in 1641; in which latter embassy he was accompanied by the lord of Brede-rode as first ambassador, and Heemsvliet as third, to negotiate the marriage of Prince William, son of the prince of Orange, with a daughter of Charles I. He was likewise ambassador extraordinary at the French court in 1624, at the beginning of Cardinal Richelieu’s administration, who had a high opinion of him. His unpublished memoirs of the negotiations in which he was engaged, show him to have been one of the ablest men of his time, and worthy of the confidence and trust reposed in him by his country. But his character is not altogether without stain. His enmity to the Remonstrants was bitter and unrelenting; and he is supposed to have greatly encouraged the violent measures pursued by Prince Maurice against the venerable Barneveldt, and to have been the principal adviser for assembling the persecuting synod of Dordrecht. He died at a very advanced age; and his son, who survived him, was reputed the wealthiest man in Holland.\n",

He is the most celebrated doctor of the orthodox Mussulmans, and his sect is the most esteemed of the four which they indifferently follow. Almansor caused him to be imprisoned at Bagdad, for having refused to subscribe to the opinion of absolute predestination, which the Mussulmans call Cadha; but afterwards Abou Joseph, who was the sovereign judge or chancellor of the empire under the caliph Hadi, brought his doctrine into such credit, that it became a prevailing opinion, That to be a good Mussulman was to be a Hanifite. He died in the 150th year of the Hegira, in the prison of Bagdad: and it was not till 335 years after his death, that Melick Schah, a sultan of the Selgiucidan race, erected to his memory a magnificent monument in the same city, and a college for his followers, in the 485th year of the Hegira, and anno Christi 1092.\n",

It is in N. lat. 39½. and connects at its eastern extremity with Mount Ararat Aba. See Abae. Aba, Albon, or Ovon, a king of Hungary. He married the sister of Stephen I. and was elected king on the deposition of Peter in 1041. The emperor Henry III. preparing to reinstate Peter on the throne, Aba made an incursion into his dominions, and returned loaded with booty; but was next year obliged to make restitution, by paying a large sum, in order to prevent a threatened invasion from the emperor. He indulged in great familiarity with the lower class of the people; on account of which, and his severity to their order, he became universally odious to the nobility. The fugitive nobles, aided by the emperor, excited a revolt against him. After a bloody battle, Aba was put to flight; and was murdered by his own soldiers in 1044, having reigned three years.\n",

The sails are said to be taken aback when they arc brought into this situation, either by a sudden change of the wind, or by an alteration in the ship’s course. They are laid aback, to effect an immediate retreat, without turning to the right or left; or, in the sea phrase, to give the ship stern-way, in order to avoid some danger discovered before her in a narrow channel, or when she has advanced beyond her station in the line of battle, or otherwise. The sails are placed in this position by slackening their lec braces, and hauling in the weather ones; so that the whole effort of the wind is exerted on the fore part of their surface, which readily pushes the ship astern, unless she is restrained by some counteracting force.\n",

      "Abacus, or Abaciscus, in Architecture, signifies the superior part or member of the capital of a column, and serves as a kind of crowning to both. Vitruvius tells us the abacus was originally intended to represent a square tile laid over an urn, or rather over a basket. The form of the abacus is not the same in all orders: in the Tuscan, Doric, and Ionic, it is generally square; but in the Corinthian and Composite, its four sides are arched inwards, and embellished in the middle with some ornament, as a rose or other flower. Scammozzi uses abacus for a concave moulding on the capital of the Tuscan pedestal; and Palladio calls the plinth above the echinus, or boultin, in the Tuscan and Doric orders, by the same name.\n",
      "Abacus is also the name of an ancient instrument for facilitating operations in arithmetic. The exhibition of numbers by counters appears happily fitted for unfolding the principles of calculation. In the schools of ancient Greece, the boys acquired the elements of knowledge by working on a smooth board with a narrow rim,—the Abax ; so named, evidently, from the combination of A, B, Γ, the first letters of their alphabet, resembling, except perhaps in size, the tablet likewise called A, B, C, on which the children with us used to begin to learn the art of reading. The pupils, in those distant ages, were instructed to compute, by forming progressive rows of counters, which, according to the wealth or fancy of the individual, consisted of small pebbles, of round bits of bone or ivory, or even of silver coins. From ∙fyηφος, the Greek word for a pebble, comes the verb ψη<ριζειν, to compute. But the same board served also for teaching the rudiments of writing and the principles of Geometry. The Abax being strewed with green sand, the pulvis eruditus of classic authors, it was easy, with a radius or small rod, to trace letters, draw lines, construct triangles, or describe circles.—Besides the original word A j Sαξ, the Greeks had the diminutive Αβαχιον∙, and it seems very probable, that this smaller board was commonly used for calculations, while the larger one was reserved among them for the purpose of tracing geometrical diagrams.\n",
      "To their calculating board the ancients make frequent allusions. It appears, from the relation of Diogenes Laertius, that the practice of bestowing on pebbles an artificial value, according to the rank or place which they occupied, remounts higher than the age of Solon, the great reformer and legislator of the Athenian commonwealth. This sagacious observer and disinterested statesman, who was, however, no admirer of regal government, used to \"compare the passive ministers of kings or tyrants to the counters or pebbles of arithmeticians, which are sometimes most important, and at other times quite insignificant.^[1. Ελεγε δε τους πaga τοις τυgaννοις δυνaμενους πagaπλησιους εινaι τaις Υτ φοις TAIΣ ΕΠΙ ΤΩΝ ΛΟΓΙΣΜΩΝ, χαι γαο εκείνων εχαστνιν τrοτε μεν ΠΛΕΙΩ σημαινειν, τrοτε δε 'HTTΩ. (DiOG. Laert. in Vita Solonis.)] Aeschines, in his oration for the Crown, speaking[7:2:6] of balanced accounts, says, that the pebbles were cleared away, and none left. ^[2. Kqν χaθaξaι ωσιv aι Aηφοι, χaι μηδιv t rεξ r . (Demosthenes pro Corona.)] His rival, Demosthenes, repeating his expression, employs further the verb οοντανελειν, which means to take up as many counters as were laid down. It is evident, therefore, that the ancients, in keeping their accounts, did not separately draw together the credits and the debts, but set down pebbles for the former, and took up pebbles for the latter. As soon as the board beeame cleared, the opposite claims were exactly balanced. We may observe, that the phrase to clear ones scores or accounts, meaning to settle or adjust them, is still preserved in the popular language of Europe, being suggested by the same practice of reckoning with counters, which prevailed indeed until a comparatively late period.\n",
      "The Romans borrowed their Abacus from the Greeks, and never aspired higher in the pursuit of science. To each pebble or counter required for that board they gave the name of calculus, a diminutive formed from calx, a stone ; and applied the verb calculare, to signify the operation of combining or separating sueh pebbles or counters. Hence innumerable allusions by the Latin authors. Ponere calculum — subducere calculum, to put down a counter, or to take it up ; that is, to add or subtract; vocare aliquid ad calculum, ut par sit ratio acceptarum et datorum — to submit any thing to calculation, so that the balance of debtor and creditor may be struck. The emperor Helvius Pertinax, who had been taught, while a boy, the arts of writing and casting aeeounts, is said, by Julius Capitolinus, to be litteris elementariis et calculo imbutus. St Augustine, whose juvenile years were devoted to pleasure and dissipation, acquaints us, in his extraordinary Confessions, that to him no song ever sounded more odious than the repetition or cantio, that one and one make two, and two and two make four. The use of the Abacus, called sometimes likewise the Mensa Pythagorica, formed an essential part of the education of every noble Roman youth:\n",

Of these, the librarius or miniculator, was employed in teaching the children their letters; but the notarius registered expenses, the rationarius adjusted and settled accounts, and the tabularius or calculator, working with his counters and board, performed what computations nιight be required. Sometimes these laborious combiners of numbers were termed reproachfully canculones or calculones. In the fervour of operation, their gestures must often have appeared constrained and risible.\n",

      "To facilitate the working by counters, the construction of the abacus was afterwards improved. Instead of the perpendicular lines or bars, the board had its surface divided by sets of parallel grooves, by stretched wires, or even by successive rows of holes. It was easy to move small counters in the grooves, to slide perforated beads along the wires, or to stick large nobs or round-headed nails in the different holes. To diminish the number of marks required, every column was surmounted by a shorter one, wherein each counter had the same value as five of the ordinary kind, being half the index of the Denary Seale. The abacus, instead of wood, was often, for the sake of convenience and durability, made of metal, frequently brass, and sometimes silver. In the Plate entitled Arithmetic, we have copied, from the third volume of the Supplement added by Polenus to the immense Thesaurus of Graevius, two varieties of this instrument, as used by the Romans. They both rest on good authorities, having been delineated from antique monuments,—the first kind by Ursinus, and the second by Marcus Velserus. In the one, the numbers are represented by flattish perforated beads, ranged on parallel wires; and, in the other, they are signified by small round counters moving in parallel grooves. These instruments contain each seven capital bars, expressing in order units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, and millions ; and above them are shorter bars following the same progression, but having five times the relative value. With four beads on each of the long wires, and [7:2:7] one bead on every corresponding short wire, it is evident d that any number could be expressed, as far as ten millions.\n",
      "In all these, the Denary Scale is followed uniformly; but there is, besides, a small appendage to the arrangement founded on the Duodenary System. Immediately below the place of units is added a bar, with its corresponding branch, both marked Θ, being designed to signify ounces, or the twelfth parts of a pound. Five beads on the long wire, and one bead on the short wire, equivalent now to six, would therefore denote eleven ounces. To express the simpler fractions of an ounce, three very short bars are annexed behind the rest; a bead on the one marked S or 5, the contraction for Semissis, denoting half an ounce ; a bead on the other, which is marked by the inverted Q, the contraction for Sicilicum, signifying the quarter of an ounce ; and a bead on the last very short bar, marked 2, a contraction for the symbol + or Dinae Sextulae, intimating a duella or two-sixths, that is, the third part of an ounce. The second form of the abacus differs in no essential respect from the first, the grooves only supplying the place of parallel wires.\n",
      "We should observe that the Romans applied the same word abacus, to signify an article of luxurious furniture, resembling in shape the arithmetical board, but often highly ornamental, and destined for a very different purpose,—the relaxation and the amusement of the opulent. It was used in a game apparently similar to that of chess, which displayed a lively image of the struggles and vicissitudes of war. The infamous and abandoned Nero took particular delight in this sort of play, and drove along the surface of the abacus with a beautiful quadriga, or chariot of ivory.\n",
      "The civil arts of Rome were communicated to other nations by the tide of victory, and maintained through the vigour and firmness of her imperial sway. But the simpler and more useful improvements survived the wreck of empire, among the various people again restored by fortune to their barbarous independence. In all transactions wherein money was concerned, it was found convenient to follow the procedure of the Abacus, in representing numbers by counters placed in parallel rows. During the middle ages, it became the usual practice over Europe for merchants, auditors of accounts, or judges appointed to decide in matters of revenue, to appear on a covered bank or bench, so called, from an old Saxon or Franconian word, signifying a seat. Hence those terms were afterwards appropriated to offices for receiving pledges, chambers for the accommodation of money-dealers, or courts for. the trying of questions respecting property or the claims of the Crown. Hence also the word bankrupt, which occurs in all the dialects of Europe. The term scaccarium, from which was derived the French, and thence the English name for the Exchequer, anciently signified merely a chess-board, being formed from scaccum, denoting one of the movable pieces in that intricate game. The. reason of this application of the term is sufficiently obvious. The table for accounts was, to facilitate the calculations, always covered with a cloth, resembling the surface of the scaccariwm or abacus, and distinguished by perpendicular and chequered lines. The learned Skene was therefore mistaken in supposing that the Exchequer derived its name from the play of chess, because its suitors appear to fight a keen and dubious battle.^[3. “Because mony persons conveenis in the Checker to playe their causes, contrare uthers, as gif they were fechtand in an arrayed battell, quilk is the forme and ordour of the said playe.” (Skene, ad voc. Scαccαxwrn.')]\n",
      "The Court of Exchequer, which takes cognizance of all questions of revenue, was introduced into England by the Norman conquest. Richard Fitznigel, in a treatise or dialogue on the subject, written about the middle of the twelfth century, says that the scaccarium was a quadrangular table about ten feet long and five feet broad, with a ledge or border about four inches high, to prevent any thing from rolling over, and was surrounded on all sides by seats for the judges, the tellers, and other officers. It was covered every year, after the term of Easter, with fresh black cloth, divided by perpendicular white lines, or distinctures, at intervals of about a foot or a palm, and again parted by similar transverse lines. In reckoning, they proceeded, he says, according to the rules of arithmetic,^[4. He calls it Arisrnciica: In the Myτroιιrof the iVorlde, printed by Caxton, in 1481, it is strangely named Ars Λfetrike ι a nroof of the total ignorance of Greek at that period in England.] using small coins for counters. The lowest bar exhibited pence, the one above it shillings, the next pounds ; and the higher bars denoted successively tens, twenties, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands of pounds; though, in those early times of penury and severe economy, it very seldom happened that so large a sum as the last ever came to be reckoned. The first bar, therefore, advanced by dozens, the second and third by seores, and the rest of the stock of bars by the multiples of ten. The teller sat about the middle of the table; on his right hand eleven pennies were heaped on the first bar, and a pile of nineteen shillings on the second; while a quantity of pounds was collected opposite to him, on the third bar. For the sake of expedition, he might employ a different mark to represent half the value of any bar, a silver penny for ten shillings, and'a gold penny for ten pounds.\n",
      "In early times, a chequered board, the emblem of calculation, was hung out, to indicate an office for changing money. It was afterwards adopted as the sign of an inn or hostelry, where victuals were sold, or strangers lodged and entertained. We may perceive traces of that ancient practice existing even at present. It is customary in London, and in some provincial towns, to have a chequer, diced with red and white, painted against the sides of the door of a chop-house.\n",
      "The use of the smaller abacus in assisting numerical computation was not unknown during the middle ages. In England, however, it appears to have scarcely entered into actual practice, being mostly confined to those “slender clerks” who, in such a benighted period, passed for men of science and learning. The calculator was styled, in correct Latinity, abacista ; but, in the Italian dialect, abbachista, or abbachiere. A different name came afterwards to be imposed. The Arabians, who, under the appellation of Saracens or Moors, conquered Spain, and enriched that insulated country by commendable industry and skill, had likewise introduced their mathematical science. Having adopted a most refined species of numeration, to which they gave the barbarous name of algaris-mus, algorismus, or algorithmus, from the definite article al, and the Greek word αζι6μος, or number, this compound term was adopted by the Christians of the West, in their admiration of superior skill, to signify calculation in general, long before the peculiar mode had become known and practised among them. The term algarism was corrupted in English into augrim or awgrym, as printed by Wynkyn [7:2:8] de Worde, at the end of the fifteenth century; and applied even to the pebbles or counters used in ordinary calculation. In confirmation of this remark, we shall not scruple to quote a passage from our ancient poet Chaucer, who flourished about a century before, and whose verses, however rude, are sometimes highly graphic.\n",

      "The abacus, with its store of counters, wanted the valuable property of being portable, and was at all times evidently a clumsy and most incommodious implement of calculation. In many cases, it became quite indispensable to adopt some sure and ready method of expressing at least the lower numbers. The ancients employed the variously combined inflections of the fingers on both hands to signify the numerical series, and on this narrow basis they framed a system of considerable extent. In allusion to the very ancient practice of numbering by the arbitrary play of the fingers, Orontes, the son-in-law of Artaxerxes, having incurred the weighty displeasure of that monarch, is reported by Plutarch to have exclaimed in terms exactly of the same import as those before ascribed to Solon, that “the favourites of kings resemble the fingers of the arithmetician, being sometimes at the top and sometimes at the bottom of the scale, and are equivalent at one time to ten thousand, and at another to mere units.”^[5.

      "Among the Romans likewise, the, allusions to the mode of expressing numbers by the varied inflection of the fingers, are very frequent. Hence the classical expressions, computare digitis, and numerare per digitos ; and hence the line of Ausonius,\n",
      "In this play of the fingers great dexterity was acquired; and hence the phrase which so frequently occurs in the Classics— micare digitis. It was customary to begin with the left hand, and thence proceed to the right hand, on which the different combined inflections indicated exactly one hundred times more. Hence the peculiar force of this passage from Juvenal:\n",
      "Rex Pylius, magno si quicquam credis Homero,\n",
      "Exemplum vitae fuit a cornice secundae;\n",
      "Felix nimirum, qui tot per saecula mortem\n",
      "Distulit, atque sups jam dextra computat annos.\n",
      "Sat. X. 246-249.\n",
      "Many such allusions to the mode of indicating numbers by the varied position of the fingers or the hands, occur in the writings of Cicero and Quintilian. The ancients, indeed, for want of better instruments, were tempted to push that curious art to a very great extent. By a single inflection of the fingers of the left hand, they proceeded as far as ten; and by combining another inflection with it, they could advance to an hundred. The same signs on the right hand, being augmented, as wc have seen, an hundredfold, carried them as far as ten thousand; and by a further combination, those signs, being referred successively to different parts of the body, were again multiplied an hundred times, and therefore extended to a million. This kind of pantomime outlived the subversion of the Roman empire, and was particularly fitted for the slothful religious orders who fattened on its ruins, and, relinquishing every manly pursuit, recommended silence as a virtue, or enjoined it as an obligation. Our venerable Bede has explained the practice of manual numeration at some length; and we have given (see Plate Arithmetic) a small specimen of such inflections and digital signs.\n",
      "These signs were merely fugitive, and it became necessary to adopt other marks, of a permanent nature, for the purpose of recording numbers. But of all the contrivances adopted with this view, the rudest undoubtedly is the method of registering by tallies, introduced into England along with the Court of Exchequer, as another badge of the Norman conquest. These consist of straight well-seasoned sticks, of hazel or willow, so called from the French verb tailler, to cut, because they are squared at each end. The sum of money was marked on the side with notches, by the cutter of tallies, and likewise inscribed on both sides in Roman characters, by the writer of the tallies. The smallest notch signified a penny, a larger one a shilling, and one still larger a pound; but other notches, increasing successively in breadth, were made to denote ten, a hundred, and a thousand. The stick was then cleft through the middle by the deputy-chamberlains, with a knife and a mallet; the one portion being called the tally, or sometimes the scachia, stipes, or kancia ; and the other portion named the countertally, or folium.\n",
      "After the union with Scotland had been concluded in 1707, a store of hazel rods for tallies was sent down to Edinburgh, being intended, no doubt, as a mighty refinement on the Scottish mode of keeping accounts. Their advantages, however, were not perceived or acknowledged, and they have since been suffered, we believe, to lie as so much useless lumber. But the case is very different in England, where a blind am⅛slavish attachment to ancient forms, however ridiculous they may through time have become, is almost constantly opposed to the general progress of society. Were a sensible traveller from India or China to visit our metropolis, and report, on his return home, that a nation highly polished, enlightened, and opulent, yet keep their accounts of the public revenue, surpassing annually many millions of pounds, by means of notches cut on willow rods,—he would certainly not be credited, but supposed to use the licence of substituting a description of the practice of the most savage tribes of the American Continent.\n",
      "The Chinese have, from the remotest ages, used in all their calculations, an instrument called the Swan-Pan, or Computing Table, similar in its shape and construction to the abacus of the Romans, but more complete and uniform. It consists of a small oblong board surrounded by a high ledge, and parted lengthwise near the top by another ledge. It is then divided vertically by ten smooth and slender rods of bamboo, on which are strung two [7:2:9] small balls of ivory or bone in the upper compartment, and five such balls in the lower and larger compartment; each of the latter on the several bars denoting unit, and each of the former, for the sake of abbreviation, expressing five. See Plate (Arithmetic), where the balls are actually set to signify the numbers annexed.\n",
      "The system of measures, weights, and coins, which prevails throughout the Chinese empire, being entirely founded on the decimal subdivision, the swan-pan was admirably suited for representing it. The calculator could begin at any particular bar, and reckon with the same facility either upwards or downwards. This advantage of treating fractions exactly like integers was, in practice, of the utmost consequence. Accordingly, those arithmetical machines, but of very different sizes, are constantly used in all the shops and booths of Canton and other cities, and are said to be handled by the native traders with such rapidity and address as quite astonish the European factors.\n",
      "But the Chinese have also contrived a very neat and simple kind of digital signs for denoting numbers, greatly superior, both in precision and extent, to the method practised by the Romans. Since every finger has three joints, let the thumb-nail of the other hand touch those joints in succession, passing up the one side of the finger, down the middle, and again up the other side, and it will give nine different marks, applicable to the Denary Scale of arrangement. On the little finger those marks signify units, on the next finger tens, on the mid-finger hundreds, on the index thousands, and on the thumb hundred thousands. With the combined positions of the joints of the one hand, therefore, it was easy to advance by signs as far as a million. To illustrate more fully this ingenious practice, we have, immediately below the koua of the Emperor Fou-hi, copied (See Plate), from a Chinese elementary treatise of education, the figure of a hand, noted at the several joints of each finger, by characters along the inside, corresponding to one, two, and three, down the middle by those answering to four, five, and six, and again up the outside by characters expressing seven, eight, and nine. It is said that the merchants in China are accustomed to conclude bargains with each other by help of those signs; and that often, from selfish or fraudulent views, they conceal the pantomime from the knowledge of by-standers, by only seeming to seize the hand with a hearty grasp. „ (b.)

That angel-king is by some thought to be Satan or the devil; but Mr le Clerc thinks with Dr Hammond, that by the locusts which came out of the abyss, may be understood the zealots and robbers, who miserably afflicted the land of Judea, and laid it in a manner waste, before Jerusalem was taken by the Romans; and that Abaddon, the king of the locusts, may be John of Gischala, who having treacherously left that town a little before it was surrendered to Titus, came to Jerusalem, where he soon headed part of the zealots, who acknowledged him as their king, whilst the rest would not submit to him. This subdivision of the zealot party brought a thousand calamities on the Jews.\n",

This instrument, which is mentioned by Galen, Fabricius ab Aquapendente, and others, was a conical saw with a circular edge.

A new instrument has been lately invented for this purpose. This instrument is so contrived, that it can be fitted to cut any thickness of bone without danger of injuring the brain; and as no pivot or centre pin is necessary, the dreadful accidents which have sometimes happened by not removing it, when the instrument in common use is employed, are completely avoided.

      "ABARIS, the Hyperborean, a celebrated sage of antiquity, whose history and travels have been the subject of much learned discussion. Such a number of fabulous stories^[1. Jamblichi Vita Ρythag.] were told of him, that Herodotus himself seems to scruple to relate them. He tells us only,^[2. Lib. iv. cap. 36.] that this barbarian was said to have travelled with an arrow, and to have taken no sustenance; but this does not acquaint us with the marvellous properties which were attributed to that arrow; nor that it had been given him by the Hyperborean Apollo. With regard to the occasion of his leaving his native country, Harpocration^[3. Under the word Afαf<i∙] tells us, that the whole earth being infested with a deadly plague, Apollo, upon being consulted, gave no other answer than that the Athenians should offer up prayers in behalf of all other nations; upon which, several countries deputed ambassadors to Athens, among whom was Abaris the Hyperborean. In this journey, he renewed the alliance between his countrymen and the inhabitants of the island of Delos. It appears that he also went to Lacedaemon; since according to some writers,^[4. Pausanias lib.iii.p.94.] he there built a temple consecrated to Proserpine the Salutary. It is asserted, that he was capable of foretelling earthquakes, driving away plagues, laying storms,^[5. Porphyry in Vita Pythagor.] &c. He wrote several books, as Suidas^[6. Under the word Aet»í/ŗ.] informs us, viz. Apollo’s arrival in the country of the Hyperboreans; the nuptials of the river Hebrus; Θseyowα, or the Generation of the Gods; a collection of oracles, &c. If the Hebrides, or Western islands of Scotland, (says Mr Toland^[7. Account of the Druids, in his Posthumous Works, vol. i. p. 161.]) were the Hyperboreans of Diodorus,^[8. Diod.Sic. lib. ii. iii.] then the celebrated Abaris was of that country; and likewise a Druid, having been the priest of Apollo. Suidas, who knew not the distinction of the insular Hyperboreans, makes him a Scythian; as do some others, misled by the same vulgar error; though Diodorus has truly fixed his country in an island, and not on the continent. Indeed (continues Mr Toland) the fictions and mistakes concerning our Abaris are infinite: however, it is agreed by all that he travelled quite over Greece, and from thence into Italy, where he conversed familiarly with Pythagoras, who favoured him beyond all his disciples, by instructing him in his doctrines (especially his thoughts of nature) in a plainer and more compendious method than he did any other. This distinction could not but be very advantageous to Abaris. The Hyperborean, in return, presented the Samian, as though he equalled Apollo himself in wisdom, with the sacred arrow on which the Greeks have fabulously related^[9. Jamblichi Vita Pythag. p. 128.] that he sat astride, and flew upon it, through the air, over rivers and lakes, forests and mountains; in like manner as our vulgar still believe, particularly those of the Hebrides, that wizards and witches fly whithersoever they please on their broom-sticks. The orator Himerius above mentioned, though one of those who, from the equivocal sense of the word Hyperborean, seem to have mistaken Abaris for a Scythian, yet describes his person accurately, and gives him a very noble character. “They relate,” says he, “that Abaris the sage was by nation a Hyperborean, appeared a Grecian in speech, and resembled a Scythian in his habit and appearance. He came to Athens holding a bow in his hand, having a quiver hanging on his shoulders, his body wrapt up in a plaid, girt about the loins with a gilded belt, and wearing trousers reaching from his waist downward.” By this it is evident (says Mr Toland) that he was not habited like the Scythians, who were always covered with skins; but appeared in the native garb of an aboriginal Scot.\n",

      "ABAUZIT, Firmin, a learned Frenchman, was born at Usez, in Languedoe, in November 1679. His father died when he was but two years of age. To avoid the rigours of persecution to which the Protestants of France were exposed in the time of Louis XIV. young Abauziťs mother, who was a Protestant, fled with her son to Geneva, where he remained secure from danger, and enjoyed the benefit of education. From his 10th to his 19th year, his time was wholly devoted to literature; and having made great progress in languages, he studied mathematics, physics, and theology. In the year 1698, he travelled into Holland, where he beeame acquainted with Bayle, Basnage, and Jurieu. Thence he passed over to England, and was introduced to Sir Isaae Newton, who entertained a very high opinion of his merit. For this philosopher afterwards sent him his Commercium Epistolicum, accompanied with a very honourable testimony: “You are well worthy, says Newton, to judge between Leibnitz and me.” The reputation of Abauzit reached the ears of King William, who encouraged him by a very handsome offer to settle in England; whieh he deelined, and returned to Geneva. In 1715 he entered into the society formed for the purpose of translating the New Testament into the French language, and contributed valuable assistance to this work. The chair of philosophy in the university was offered to him in 1723, which he refused; but in 1727 he accepted .of the office of librarian to the city, the duties of which were neither burdensome, nor subjected him to any particular restraint.\n",
      "Abauzit was one of the first who embraced the grand truths which the sublime discoveries of Newton disclosed to the world. He defended the doctrines of that philosopher against Father Castel; and discovered an error in the Principia, whieh was corrected by Newton in the second edition of his work. He was a perfect master of many languages; his knowledge was extensive and profound; and the different sciences which he had studied were so well digested and arranged in his retentive mind, that he could at once bring together all that he ever knew on any subject. Rousseau (in his Heloisè) addressed to Abauzit one of the finest panegyrics which he ever wrote; and a stranger having addressed Voltaire in a flattering manner, by saying he had come to Geneva to see a great man, the poet asked him whether he had seen Abauzit.\n",

In his Essay on the Apocalypse, he endeavoured to show, that the predictions in that book were to be applied to the destruction of Jerusalem. This work was translated into English by Dr Twells, who added a refutation, which satisfied Abauzit so much that he was [7:2:12] mistaken in his views, that he ordered an edition then ready for publication in Holland to be stopped. His other theological works are, Reflections on the Eucharist; On Idolatry; On the Mysteries of Religion; and Paraphrases and Explanations of sundry parts of Scripture. His principal works were published in Holland in 1773, by Be-renger, in 2 volumes 8vo. under the title Oeuvres de feu M. Abauzit.\n",

The dukes of Aquitain were called abbots of the monastery of St Hillary at P oie-tiers; and the earls of Anjou, of St Aubin, fyc.\n",
      "Monasteries were at first established as religious houses, to which persons retired from the bustle of the world to spend their time in solitude and devotion. But they soon degenerated from their original institution, and obtained large privileges, exemptions, and riches. They prevailed greatly in Britain before the Reformation, particularly in England; and as they increased in riches, so the state became poor: for the lands which these regulars possessed were in mortua manu, i. e. could never revert to the lords who gave them. This inconvenience gave rise to the statutes against gifts in mortmain ; and Lord Coke tells us, that several lords, at their creation, had a clause in their grant, that the donor might give or sell his land to whom he would (exceptis viris religiosis et Judaeis) excepting monks and Jews.\n",
      "These places were wholly abolished in England at the time of the Reformation; Henry VIII. having first appointed visitors to inquire into the lives of the monks and nuns, which were found in some places to be extremely irregular. The abbots, perceiving their dissolution unavoidable, were induced to resign their houses to the king, who by that means became invested with the abbey lands: these were afterwards granted to different persons, whose descendants enjoy them at this day.\n",
      "Though the suppression of religious houses, even considered in a political light only, was a national benefit, it must be owned, that at the time they flourished, they were far from useless. Abbeys or monasteries were then the repositories, as well as the seminaries, of learning; many valuable books and national records, as well as private history, having been preserved in their libraries, the only places in which they could have been safely lodged in those turbulent times. Many of those which had escaped the ravages of the Danes, were destroyed with more than Gothic barbarity at the dissolution of the abbeys. These ravages are pathetically lamented by John Bale: “A number of those,” says he, “who purchased these superstitious mansions, reserved of the library books, some to serve their jakes, some to scour the candlesticks, and some to rub their boots; some they sold to the grocer and soapseller; and some they sent over sea to the bookbinders, not in small numbers, but in whole ships full; yea, the universities of this realm are not clear of so detestable a fact. I know a merchant that bought the contents of two noble libraries for 40s. price; a shame it is to be spoken! This stuff hath he occupied instead of gray paper, by the space of more than these ten years, and yet he hath store enough for as many years to come. I shall judge this to be true, and utter it with heaviness, that neither the Britons under the Romans and Saxons, nor yet the English people under the Danes and Normans, had ever such damage of their learned monuments as we have seen in our time.”\n",
      "Every abbey had at least one person whose office it was to instruct youth; and the historians of this country are chiefly beholden to the monks for the knowledge they have of former national events. In these houses also the arts of painting, architecture, and printing, were cultivated. They were hospitals for the sick and poor, and afforded entertainment to travellers at a time when there were no inns. They were likewise an asylum for aged and indigent persons of good family.\n",

      "ABBOT, or Abbat, the superior of a monastery of monks erected into an abbey or priory\n",
      "The name Abbot is originally Hebrew, where it signifies father. The Jews call father, in their language, Ab ; whence the Chaldeans and Syrians formed Abba ; thence the Greeks ACCαg, which the Latins retained; and hence our Abbot, the French Abbe, &c. St Mark and St Paul use the Syriac Abba in their Greek, by reason it was then commonly known in the synagogues and the primitive assemblies of the Christians; adding to it, by way of interpretation, the word father, ACCα ò πaτr i ν, “ Abba, father q. d. Abba, that is to say, Father. But the name Ab, or Abba, which at first was a term of tenderness and affection, became at length a title of dignity and honour. The Jewish doctors affected it; and one of their most ancient books, containing the sayings or apophthegms of divers of them, is entitled Pirke Abboth or Avoth; «. e. Chapters of the Fathers. It was in allusion to this affectation, that Jesus Christ forbade his disciples to call any man their father on earth; which word St Jerome turns against the superiors of the monasteries of his time, for assuming the titles of Abbots, or Fathers.\n",
      "The name Abbot, then, appears as old as the institution of monks itself. The governors of the primitive monasteries assumed indifferently the titles Abbots and Archimandrites. They were really distinguished from the clergy; though frequently confounded with them, because a degree above laymen.\n",
      "In those early days, the abbots were subject to the bishops and the ordinary pastors. Their monasteries being remote from cities, built in the farthest solitudes, they [7:2:14] had no share in ecclesiastical affairs. They went on Sundays to the parish church with the rest of the people; or, if they were too remote, a priest was sent them to administer the sacraments; till at length they were allowed to have priests of their own body. The abbot or archimandrite himself was usually the priest: but his function extended no farther than to the spiritual assistance' of his monastery; and he remained still in obedience to the bishop. There being among the abbots several persons of learning, they made a vigorous opposition to the rising heresies of those times; which first occasioned the bishops to call them out of their deserts, and fix them about the suburbs of cities, and at length in the cities themselves; from which era their degeneracy is to be dated. Then the abbots threw off their former plainness and simplicity, assumed the rank of prelates, aspired at being independent of the bishops, and grasped at so much power, that severe laws were made against them at the council of Chalcedon. Many of them, however, carried the point of independency, obtained the appellation of lord, and were distinguished by other badges of the episcopate, particularly the mitre.\n",
      "Hence arose new distinctions between the abbots. Those were termed mitred abbots, who were privileged to wear the mitre, and exercise episcopal authority within their respective precincts; being exempted from the jurisdiction of the bishop. Others were called crosiered abbots, from their bearing the crosier or pastoral staff. Others were styled ecumenical or universal abbots, in imitation of the patriarch of Constantinople: while others were termed cardinal abbots, from their superiority over all other abbots. In Britain, the mitred abbots were lords of parliament, and called abbots-sovereign, and abbots-general, to distinguish them from the other abbots. And as there were lords-abbots, so there were also lords-priors, who had exempt jurisdiction, and were likewise lords of parliament.\n",
      "In Roman Catholic countries, the principal distinctions observed between abbots are those of regular and commendatory. The former take the vow and wear the habit of their order; whereas the latter are seculars who have received tonsure, but are obliged by their bulls to take orders when of proper age.\n",
      "Anciently the ceremony of creating an abbot consisted in clothing him with the habit called cuculus, or cowl; putting the pastoral staff into his hand, and the shoes called pedales on his feet: but at present, it is only a simple benediction, improperly called, by some, consecration.\n",
      "Abbot is also a title given to others beside the superiors of monasteries: thus bishops whose sees were formerly abbeys, are called abbots. Among the Genoese, the chief magistrate of the republic formerly bore the title of abbot of the people.\n",
      "Abbot, George, archbishop of Canterbury, was born October 29. 1562, at Guildford in Surrey. He was the son of Maurice Abbot, a cloth-worker. He studied at Oxford, and in 1597 was chosen principal of University college. In 1599, he was installed dean of Winchester: the year following he was chosen vice-chancellor of the university of Oxford, and a second time in 1603. In 1604, the translation of the Bible now in use was begun by the direction of King James; and Dr Abbot was the second of eight divines of Oxford, to whom the care of translating the whole New Testament (excepting the Epistles) was committed. The year following, he was a third time vice-chancellor. In 1608, he went to Scotland with George Hume earl of Dunbar, to assist in establishing an union between the,churches of Scotland and England; and in this business he conducted himself with so much address and prudence, that it laid the foundation of all his future preferment. King James ever after paid great deference to his advice and counsel; and upon the death of Dr Overton, bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, he named Dr Abbot for his successor, who was accordingly constituted bishop of those two united sees in December 1609. About a month afterwards he was translated to the see of London, and on the second of November following was raised to the archiépiscopal see..\n",
      "It is not however improbable, that his extravagant adulation of his royal master, in which he went as far as any other court chaplain could do, contributed not a little to his rapid preferment. In the preface to a pamphlet which he published, the following specimen of ridiculous flattery occurs: Speaking of the king, he says, “whose life hath been so immaculate and unspotted, &c. that even malice itself, which leaves nothing unsearched, could never find true blemish in it, nor cast probable aspersion on it.—Zealous as a David; learned and wise, the Solomon of our age; religious as Josias; careful of spreading Christ’s faith as Constantine the Great; just as Moses; undefiled in all his ways as a Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah; full of clemency as another Theodosius.”—Yet, as we shall immediately see, Abbot could sometimes oppose the will of the sovereign with courage and constancy.\n",
      "His great zeal for the Protestant religion made him a strenuous promoter of the match between the Elector Palatine and the Princess Elizabeth; which was accordingly concluded and solemnized the 14th of February 1612, the archbishop performing the ceremony on a stage erected in the royal chapel. In the following year happened the famous case of divorce between the lady Frances Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk, and Robert earl of Essex; which has been considered as one of the greatest blemishes of King James’s reign. The part which the archbishop took in the business added much to the reputation he had already acquired for incorruptible integrity. It was referred by the king to a court of delegates, whose opinion the king and court wished and expected to be favourable to the divorce. But the arehbishop, unawed by royal authority, with inflexible firmness resisted it, and published his reasons for persisting in his opinion; to which the king, disappointed iņ his views, thought fit to reply: Sentence was given in the lady’s favour. In 1618, the king published a declaration, which he ordered to be read in all churches, permitting sports and pastimes on the Lord’s day: this gave great uneasiness to the archbishop, who happening to be at Croydon on the day it was ordered to be read, had the courage to forbid it.\n",
      "Being now in a declining state of health, the archbishop used in the summer to go to Hampshire for the sake of recreation; and being invited by Lord Zouch to hunt in his park at Bramzill, he met there with the greatest misfortune that ever befell him; for he accidentally killed the game-keeper by an arrow from a cross-bow which he shot at one of the deer. This fatal accident threw him into a deep melancholy; and he ever afterwards kept a monthly fast on Tuesday, the day on which it happened; and he settled an annuity of L.20 on the widow.^[1. Fuller’s Church Hist. cent. xxvii. p. 87.] Advantage was taken of this misfortune, to lessen him in the king’s favour; but, his majesty said, “An angel might have miscarried in this sort.” His enemies alleging that he had incurred an irregularity, and was thereby incapacitated for performing the offices of a primate, the king directed a commission to ten persons to inquire into this matter. The result was not satisfactory to his Grace’s enemies; it being declared, that, as the murder was involuntary, he had not forfeited his archiepiscopal character.\n",
      "The archbishop after this seldom assisted at the council[7:2:15], being chiefly hindered by his infirmities; but in the king’s last illness he was sent for, and constantly attended till his majesty expired on the 27th of March 1622. He performed the ceremony of the coronation of King Charles I. though very infirm and distressed with the gout. He was never greatly in this king’s favour; and the duke of Buckingham being his declared enemy, watched an opportunity of making him feel the weight of his displeasure. This he at last accomplished, upon the archbishop’s refusing to license a sermon, preached by Dr Sibthorpe to justify a loan which the king had demanded, and pregnant with principles which tended to overthrow the constitution. The archbishop was immediately after suspended from all his functions as primate; and they were exercised by certain bishops commissioned by the king, of whom Laud, the archbishop’s enemy, and afterwards his successor, was one; while the only cause assigned for this procedure was, that the archbishop could not at that time personally attend those services which were otherwise proper for his cognizance and direction. He did not, however, remain long in this situation; for a parliament being absolutely necessary, his Grace was sent for, and restored to his authority and jurisdiction. But not proving friendly to certain rigorous measures adopted by the prevailing church party, headed by Laud, whose power and interest at court were now very considerable, his presence became unwelcome there; so that, upon the birth of the prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II., Laud had the honour to baptize him, as dean of the chapel. The archbishop being worn out with cares and infirmities, died at Croydon, the 5th of August 1633, aged 71 years; and was buried at Guildford, the place of his nativity, where he had endowed an hospital with lands to the amount of L.300 per annum. A stately monument was erected over the grave, with his cffigy in his robes.\n",
      "He proved himself, in most circumstances of his life, to be a man of great moderation to all parties; and was desirous that the clergy should gain the respect of the laity by the sanctity and purity of their manners, rather than claim it as due to their function. His opinions and principles, however, have drawn upon him many severe reflections; particularly from the earl of Clarendon. But Dr Welwood has done more justice to his merit and abilities.^[2.

      "Abbot, Robert, elder brother to the former, was born at Guildford in 1560, and completed his studies at Baliol college, Oxford. In 1582, he took his degree of master of arts, and soon became a celebrated preacher; and to this talent he chiefly owed his preferment. Upon the first sermon at Worcester, he was chosen lecturer in that city, and soon after rector of All-saints in the same place. In 1597, he took his degree of doctor in divinity: and, in the beginning of King James’s reign, was appointed chaplain in ordinary to his majesty; who had such an opinion of him as a writer, that he ordered the doctor’s book De Antichristo to be printed, with his own commentary upon part of the Apocalypse. In 1609, he was elected master of Baliol college; which trust he discharged with the utmost care and assiduity, by his frequent lectures to the scholars, by his continual presence at public exercises, and by promoting temperance in the society. In November 1610, hc was made prebendary of Normanton in the church of Southwell; and, in 1612, his majesty appointed him regius professor of divinity at Oxford. The fame of his lectures became very great; and those which he gave upon the supreme power of kings, against Bellar-mine and Suarez, so much pleased his majesty, that when the see of Salisbury became vacant, he named him to that bishopric, and he was consecrated by his own brother at Lambeth, December 3. 1615. W z hen he came to Salisbury, he found the cathedral falling to decay, through the avarice and negligence of the clergy belonging to it; however, he found means to draw five hundred pounds from the prebendaries, which he applied towards repairing it. Here he devoted himself to the duties of his function with great diligence and assiduity, visiting his whole diocese in person, and preaching every Sunday. But his sedentary life, and close application to study, brought upon him the gravel and stone; of which he died on the 2d of March 1618, in the 58th year of his age; having filled the sec only two years and three months. He wrote, 1. The Mirror of Popish Subtleties. Lond. 1594, 4to. 2. The Exaltation of the Kingdom and Priesthood of Christ, sermons on the first seven verses of the 110th Psalm. Lond. 1601, 4to. 3.

      "ABBREVIATION, or Abbreviature, a contraction of a word or passage, made by dropping some of the letters, or by substituting certain marks or characters in their place. A late philosophical writer on grammar divides the parts of speech into words which are necessary for the communication of thought, as the noun and verb, and abbreviations which are employed for the sake of dispatch. The lĩřtter, strictly speaking, are also parts of speech, because they are all useful in language, and each has a different manner of signification. Mr Tooke, however, seems to allow that rank only to the necessary words, and tó consider all others as merely substitutes of the first sort, under the title of abbreviations. They are employed in language in three ways—in terms, in sorts of words, and in construction. Mr Locke in his Essay on the Human Understanding treats of the first class; numerous authors have written on the last; and for the second class of abbreviations, see the work of Mr Tooke entitled Diversions of Purley. Lawyers, physicians, &c. use many ab- , breviations, for the sake of expedition. But the Rabbis are the most remarkable for this practice, so that their writings are unintelligible without the Hebrew abbreviatures. The Jewish authors and copyists do not content themselves with abbreviating words like the Greeks and Latins, by retrenching some of the letters or syllables; they frequently take away all but the initial letters. They even take the initials of several succeeding words, join them together, and, adding vowels to them, make a sort of barbarous words, representative of all those which they have thus abridged. Thus, Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, in their abbreviature, is Rambam, &c.\n",

      "ABCHASIEN, a province of the Asiatic Russian empire, on the border of the Black Sea, comprehended between Lat. 42. 30. and 44. 45. N., and between Long. 37. 3.'and 40. 36. E. The high mountains of Caucasus on the north and north-west divide it from Circassia; on the south-west it is bounded by Mingrelia; and on the south, south-west, and north-west by the Black Sea. The extent is about 5080 square miles. The climate is generally mild, being defended from the northerly winds by the lofty range of mountains. The sea-coast is in many parts a sandy soil; but in many of the vallies which run up between the projections of the Caucasus the land is fertile, but better adapted for pasturage than for the growth of corn; and hence the greater part of the inhabitants are in the pastoral state. The grape and all other fruits come to perfection. Under the Turkish dominion the trifling commerce was with the Asiatic provinces of that power; but its course is now changed, and passes towards the north. The number of inhabitants is estimated at 56,500, of whom 40,000 are aboriginal. The Turcomans, Nogay Tartars, with the Greeks, Armenians, and Jews that occupy the towns and ports on the coast, are reckoned to be 15,000, and the Russians and Cossacks 1500. In early times the Abchasiens were heathens, but adopted Christianity under the Emperor Justinian, who built a church to the Virgin Mary in 550, and sent missionaries. Under the Turks their Christianity gradually disappeared; and at present the higher classes adhere to Mahomcdan-ism, whilst the mass of the people follow each a separate species of idolatry. Though by the peace of 1812 Russia entered into all the rights enjoyed by the Turks, it scarcely interfered with the interior authority of the several chiefs, who by force gain the superiority; nor does it draw any revenue from the country, but is satisfied with possession of a few commanding fortresses, and with the trade which falls into the new channels from the effect of the political changes.\n",
      "ABDALLA, the son of Abdalmotalseb, was the father of the prophet Mahomet. He was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and when he married Amina, of the noble race of the Zahrites, 200 virgins are said to have died of jealousy and despair. Several other Arabians of eminence bore the same name.\n",
      "ABDALLATIF, or Abdollatiph, a celebrated physician and traveller, and one of the most voluminous writers of the East, was born at Bagdad, in the 557th year of the Hegira, being the 1161st of the Christian era. Of the life of this learned person there has fortunately been preserved a memoir, written by himself, together with some additions by a contemporary biographer, named Osaiba. The whole of this curious piece has been translated into French, and published with a work of Abdallatif’s, of which we shall afterwards give some account. Long before the period of his birth, the empire of the Caliphs had begun to decline; but their capital still continued to enjoy those advantages for education which it had originally derived from their liberal patronage of learning and science. Abdallatif was carefully instructed in every branch of knowledge then taught in that renowned city; and the biographical piece just alluded to is not a little interesting, from the glimpses it affords of the studies which engaged the attention of the more aspiring of the Mussulman youth.\n",
      "After learning to read, the rules of grammar appear to have been studied with a degree of care and earnestness, which has not perhaps been equalled in any other country. With the study of grammar was joined that of the Koran and the traditionary doctrines, and the whole of the sacred book was carefully committed to memory. This faculty seems, indeed, to have been severely taxed; for it was also thought necessary to be able to repeat several treatises on grammar and jurisprudence, besides some of the choicer collections of Arabian poetry. In these arduous exercises, Abdallatif says that he was for a considerable time accustomed to pass the greater part of the night.\n",
      "Having attained to great proficiency in the usual studies, he afterwards applied to the natural philosophy of that day, and to medicine; and with the view of still further improving himself by converse with the learned of other places, he set out, when in his twenty-eighth year, to Mosul in Mesopotamia. Having resided about a year in this city, he next proceeded to Damascus, then a place of great resort to the learned of the surrounding countries. Abdallatif found here many of the most eminent men of that age, part of whom were busied in the chimerical pursuits of the Hermetic art, and part in philological and speculative inquiries. He seems always to have entertained great contempt for the sort of chemistry then in vogue, but he entered with eagerness into speculative discussions; and he at this time composed a treatise upon the Divine essence and attributes, in consequence of some discussions with Alkendi, a philosopher of eminence, who was not, however, thought to be quite orthodox in his faith.\n",
      "The active curiosity of Abdallatif was next directed to Egypt; and he accordingly proceeded to Acre, where its sultan, the great Saladin, was at the time encamped, in order to solicit his permission to visit that country. This monarch was a liberal protector of the learned, and fond of their conversation; but having been lately defeated by the crusaders under Richard Coeur de Lion, he was too much occupied with the cares consequent upon this disaster, to admit Abdallatif to the expected honour of a personal interview. He was, however, received in a [7:2:21] courteous manner by the Vizier Al Fadhel, whom he found in his tent writing and dictating at the same time to two secretaries; employments which he continued whilst he conversed with his visitor upon sundry points of grammar and philology. Having obtained the necessary credentials from this minister, he proceeded to Cairo; and the munificence which Saladin and his courtiers extended towards the learned, was strikingly exemplified in his reception and treatment in that city. He was provided with a house, with provisions, and money; and the vizier seldom failed to recommend him anew, in those letters of business which he had occasion to write to the governor of the place.\n",
      "Here Abdallatif enjoyed the long wished for opportunity of conversing with that Eagle of the Doctors, as he was called, the celebrated Maimonides, who had been for a considerable time settled in Egypt, and was physician to the sultan. Here, too, he was fortunate enough to meet with a sage, who weaned him of his admiration for the writings of Avicenna, by pointing out the superior value of the ancients. But the philosophers of Grand Cairo were not all of this stamp; for some of them were pretenders to the transmutation of metals, and one boasted that his art enabled him to fabricate a tent of the waters of the Nile. Having passed a considerable time in making various observations and collections in this interesting city, Abdallatif set out for Jerusalem, on learning that he would there see Saladin, who had at length concluded a truce with the crusaders.\n",
      "Saladin received him with every mark of respect for his talents, and bestowed upon him a pension. He was then busied in repairing the walls of the Holy City, himself, says Abdallatif, often carrying stones upon his shoulders, to animate the undertaking. But in spite of all his cares and projects, he daily conversed with the learned men whom his bounty had drawn around him. Abdalla-tif mentions, that when first introduced, he found him in the midst of a circle of this description; and he adds, that upon all the various subjects which were discussed, the sultan spoke with the most agreeable address, as well as ingenuity. From Jerusalem, Abdallatif returned to Damascus; and, after a considerable interval, a fresh opportunity having occurred of revisiting Egypt, he again proceeded to Cairo, where he taught medicine and philosophy for several years.\n",
      "During this period, Egypt was visited with a terrible famine and pestilence, of which, and the horrors and crimes which ensued, he has given a most appalling description in the two last chapters of his Account of this country. Human nature was scarcely ever presented to observation under so hideous an aspect; the wretched Egyptians were driven, not only to feed upon the bodies of those who had fallen victims to Avant or disease, but to seize upon children, whom they killed and devoured; and Abdallatif asserts, that they thus came to acquire such a relish for those inhuman repasts, that they with difficulty refrained from them after the famine had subsided. It was likewise during his second stay in Egypt that he witnessed an insane attempt to pull down the Pyramids; a project to which the reigning sultan (a son of Saladin’s, who, after his death, succeeded to this part of his dominions) had been instigated by some of his favourites, and in which he persisted for eight months, without being able to make any sensible impression upon these indestructible monuments of the ancient world.\n",
      "About the year 1207, Abdallatif left Egypt for his former residence, Damascus; and here he for some time practised as a physician, and lectured upon medicine with great success. But his love of new scenes, and desire of extending his knowledge and fame, still urged him to travel ;‘ and he seems to have passed the resŧ ł of’his life in Aleppo, and various parts of Armenia and-Asia Minor, acquiring both wealth and glory by his abðitiés hs a physician and an author. Having returned to his native city, purposing to present some of his works to the caliph', and then to set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca, he was seized with illness soon after his arrival, and died -there in the year 1231.\n",
      "He was undoubtedly a person of great knowledge, and of an ardent, inquisitive, and penetrating mind. According to his Arabian biographer, to whom*he was well known, he showed himself, in conversation, somewhat vain of his own attainments; and was accustomed to speak rather scornfully of most of his contemporaries. But it ought to be mentioned, to the credit of his understanding, that his derision seems partly to have flowed from his contempt of those chemical fooleries to which they were so much addicted, that, to use the words of Gibbon, “the reason and the fortune of thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of Alchemy.”\n",
      "Of that long list of treatises on medicine, philosophy, and literature, which Osaiba has appended to the account of Abdallatif’s life, one only has found its way into Europe; nor do any of the others appear to be known at this day in the East. The work here alluded to is his Account of Egypt, which was fortunately discovered and brought to this country by our celebrated orientalist Pococke. The manuscript, which is a very old one, is still preserved in the Bodleian Library. Of this work, an elegant edition, with a Latin translation, notes, and a life of Abdallatif, was published in 1800, by Dr White, professor of Arabic in the University of x Oxford. A French translation, with enlarged notes, was published at Paris in 1810, by Μ. Silvestre de Sacy; and to this, among other valuable illustrations, is appended a translation from an Arabic manuscript, of the curious biographical memoir to which we have above alluded.\n",
      "This account of Egypt consists of two books; the first of which, in six chapters, gives a general view of the country, of its plants, animals, antiquities, buildings, and modes of navigating on the Nile; and the second, in three chapters, treats at large of this river, and of that terrible famine already mentioned, which was occasioned by a failure in the usual annual increase of its waters. The book undoubtedly is, upon the whole, one of the most interesting productions which has come to us from the East; inasmuch as it presents us with a detailed and authentic view of the state of Egypt during the middle ages, and thus supplies a link which was wanting between the accounts of ancient and of modern times.\n",

      "ABDALMALEK, the son of Mirvan, and the fifth caliph of the race of the Ommiades. He surpassed all his predecessors in power and dominion; for in his reign the Indies were conquered in the east, and his armies penetrated Spain in the west: he likewise extended his empire toward the south, by making himself master of Medina and Mecca. Under his reign the Greek language and character were excluded from the accounts of the public revenue. If this change, says Gibbon, was productive of the invention or familiar use of the Arabic or Indian ciphers, which are our present numerals, a regulation of office·has promoted the most important discoveries of arithmetic, algebra, and the mathematical sciences. He began his reign in the 65th of the Hegira, a. tí. 684; [7:2:22] reigned 15 years; and four of his sons successively enjoyed the caliphate.\n",

      "ABDALONYMUS, or Abdolonymus, in classic history, of the royal family of Sidon, and descended from King Cinyras, lived in obscurity, and subsisted by cultivating a garden, while Strato was in possession of the crown of Sidon. Alexander the Great having deposed Strato, inquired whether any of the race of Cinyras was living, that he might set him on the throne. It was generally thought that the whole race was extinet; but at last Abdalonymus was thought of, and mentioned to Alexander, who immediately ordered some of his soldiers to fetch him. They found the good man at work, happy in his poverty, and entirely a stranger to the noise of arms, with which all Asia was at that time disturbed; and they could scarcely persuade him they were in earnest. Alexander was convinced of his high descent by the dignity of his person; and not only bestowed on him all that belonged to Strato, but augmented his dominions, and gave him a large present out of the Persian spoils.\n",
      "ABDALS, in the eastern countries, a kind of saints supposed to be inspired to a degree of madness. The word is perhaps derived from the Arabic, Abdallah, the servant of God. Hurried on by excess of zeal, especially in the Indies, they often run about the streets, and kill all they meet who are of a different religion. The English sailors call this running a muck, from the name of the instrument, a sort of poniard, which they employ on those desperate occasions. If they are killed, as it commonly happens before they have done much jnischief, they reckon it highly meritorious; and are esteemed, by the vulgar, martyrs for their faith.\n",
      "ABDERA, in Ancient Geography, a maritime town of Thrace, not far from the mouth of the river Nessus, on the east side. The Abderites, or Abdcritani, were very much derided for their want of wit and judgment: yet their city has given birth to several eminent persons; as Protagoras, Democritus, Anaxarchus, Hecataeus the historian, Nicenaetus the poet, and many others, who were mentioned among the illustrious men. In the reign of Lysimachus, Abdera was afflicted for some months with a most extraordinary disease:^[1. Lucianus, quοmοdο Hist, sit cοιιscribeη-dus initio.] this was a burning fever, whose crisis was always on the seventh day, and then it left them; but it so distracted their imaginations, that they fancied themselves players. After this, they were ever repeating verses from some tragedy, and particularly from the Andromeda of Euripides, as if they had been upon the stage; so that many of these pale meagre actors were pouring forth their tragic exclamations in every street. This delirium continued till the winter following; which was a very cold one, and therefore fitter to remove it. Lucian, who has described this disease, endeavours to account for it in this manner: Archelaus, an excellent player, acted the Andromeda of Euripides before the Abderites, in the height of a very hot summer. Several had a fever at their coming out of the theatre; and as their imaginations were full of the tragedy, the delirium which the fever raised perpetually represented Andromeda, Perseus, Medusa, &c. and the several dramatic incidents, and called up the ideas of those objects, and the pleasure of the representation, so strongly, that they could not forbear imitating Archelaus’s action and declamation: And from these the fever spread to others by infection.\n",

At length he was met at Tours by Charles Martel, who had received reinforcements of Germans and Gepidae; and after many skirmishes,, the Saracen army, in a general action, was totally routed, and Abder-ahma was killed, with 370,000 Moors.

In this sense, Dioclcsian is said to have abdicated the crown; Philip IV. of Spain ’ resigned it. It is said to be a renunciation, quitting, and relinquishing, so as to have nothing further to do with a thing; or the doing of such actions as are inconsistent with the holding of it. On King James’s leaving the kingdom, and abdicating the government, the lords proposed that the word desertion should be employed; but the commons thought that it was not sufficiently comprehensive. Among the Roman writers it is more particularly used for the act whereby a father discarded or disclaimed his son, and expelled him the family. It is distinguished from exhaere-datio or disinheriting, in that the former was done in the father’s lifetime; the latter, by will at his death: so that whoever was abdicated, was also disinherited; but not vice versa.\n",

      "ABELARD, Peter, an eminent scholastic philosopher of France, of noble descent, was born at Palais near Nantes in Bretagne, in the year 1079. Devoted to letters by his father’s appointment, and by his own inclination, his literary attainments could at this time only be exhibited in the field of scholastic philosophy; and, that he might be fitted for his destined career of life, he was placed, after a previous course of grammatical studies, under the tuition of Rosceline, a celebrated metaphysician, and founder of the sect of the Nominalists. Under the instructions of this able master, at the early age of sixteen, he furnished himself with a large store of scholastic knowledge, and acquired a subtiltyand quickness of thought, a fluency of speech, and facility of expression, which were necessary qualifications in scholastic disputation.\n",
      "Having spent some time in visiting the schools of several provinces, in the twentieth year of his age he fixed his residence in the university of Paris, then the first seat of learning in Europe. The master, William de Champeaux, was at that time in high repute for his knowledge of philosophy, and his skill in the dialectic art; to him he committed the direction of his studies, and was at first contented with receiving instruction from so eminent a preceptor. De Champeaux was proud of the talents of his pupil, and admitted him to his friendship. But the aspiring youth ventured to contradict the opinions of his master, and in the public school held disputations with him, in which he was frequently victorious. The jealousy of the master and-the vanity of the pupil naturally occasioned a speedy separation.\n",
      "Elated by success, and confident of his own powers, Abelard, without hesitation, at the age of twenty-two, opened a public school of his own. Melun, a town ten leagues -from Paris, where the court frequently resided, was the place which he chose for this bold display of his talents. But it was not without considerable difficulty that Abelard executed his plan; for De Champeaux, who regarded him as a rival, openly employed all his interest against him. Abelard at length prevailed, his school was opened, and his lectures were attended by crowded and admiring auditories. Emboldened by this success, and perhaps stimulated by unworthy resentment, Abelard resolved to maintain an open contest with his master, and for this purpose removed his school to Corbeil near Paris. The disputants frequently met in each other’s schools; and the contest was supported on each side with great spirit, amidst crowds of their respective scholars. The young champion was in the end victorious, and his antagonist was obliged to retire.\n",
      "Constant application and violent exertions had how so far impaired Abelard’s health, that it was become necessary for him to interrupt his labours; and, with the advice of his physician, he withdrew to his native country. Two years afterwards, he returned to Corbeil,∙and found that De Champeaux had taken the monastic habit among the regular canons in the convent of St Victor; but that he still continued to teach rhetoric and logic, and to hold public disputations in theology. Returning to the charge, he renewed the contest, and his opponent was obliged to acknowledge himself defeated. The scholars of De Champeaux deserted him, and went over in crowds to Abelard. Even the new professor, who had taken the former school of De Champeaux, voluntarily surrendered the chair to the young philosopher, and requested to be enrolled among his disciples. A triumph so complete, while it gratified the vanity of Abelard, could not fail to provoke the resentment of his old master, who had influence to obtain the appointment of a new professor, and drive Abelard back to Melun. De Champeaux’s motive for this violent proceeding was soon perceived; even his friends were ashamed of his conduct; and he retired from the convent into the country. W’hen Abelard was informed of the flight of his adversary, he returned towards Paris, and took a new station at the abbey on Mount St Genevieve. His rival, the new professor, was unequal to the contest, and was soon deserted by his pupils, who flocked to the lectures of Abelard. De Champeaux, too, returning to his monastery, renewed the struggle; but so unsuccessfully, that Abelard was again victorious.\n",
      "During a short absence, in which Abelard visited his native place, De Champeaux was preferred to the see of Chalons. The long and singular contest between these philosophers terminated; and Abelard, perhaps for want of a rival to stimulate his exertions, or possibly through envy of the good fortune of his rival, determined to exchange the study and profession of philosophy for that of theology. He therefore quitted his school at St Genevieve, and removed to Laon, to become a scholar of Anselm. From this celebrated master he entertained high expectations; but they were soon disappointed. On attending his lectures, he found that, though he possessed uncommon fluency of language, he left his auditors without instruction. Abelard gradually retired from these unprofitable lectures, but without offering offence either to the veteran professor or his scholars. In conversation one of them asked him, what he thought of the study of the Scriptures? Abelard replied, that he thought the ex [7:2:24] planation of them a task of no great difficulty; and to prove his assertion, he undertook to give a comment, the next day, upon any part of the Scriptures they should mention. They fixed upon the beginning of the prophecy of Ezekiel; and the next morning he explained the passage in a theological lecture, which was heard with admiration. For several successive days, the lectures were, at the request of the∙audience, continued; the whole town pressed to hear them; and the name of Abelard was echoed through the streets of Laon. Anselm, jealous of the rising fame of this young theologian, prohibited his lectures, under the pretence that so young a lecturer might fall into mistakes, which would bring discredit upon his master. Abelard, whose ambition required a wider field than that ot Laon, obeyed the prohibition, and withdrew. He returned to Paris, whither the fame of his theological talents had arrived before him, and opened his school with his lectures on the prophecy of Ezekiel. His auditors were delighted; his school was crowded with scholars; and he united in his lectures the sciences of theology and philosophy with so much success, that multitudes repaired to him from various parts of France, from Spain, Italy, Germany, Flanders, and Great Britain.\n",
      "Hitherto Abelard has appeared with high distinction, as an able disputant, and a popular preceptor: we must now view him under a different character, and when nearly arrived at the sober age of forty, see him, on a sudden, exchanging the school of philosophy for the bower of pleasure, and even disgracing himself, as will too plainly appear in the sequel, by forming and executing a deliberate plan for the seduction of female innocence. It happened that there was at this time, resident in Paris, Heloise, the niece of Fulbert, one of the canons of the cathedral church, a lady about eighteen years of age, of great personal beauty, and highly celebrated for her literary attainments. Abelard, whose vanity had been satiated with fame, and the vigour of whose mind was now enervated by repose, found himself inclined to listen to the voice of passion. He beheld with ardent admiration the lovely Heloise, and confident that his personal attractions were still irresistible, he determined to captivate her affections. Fulbert, who doubtless thought himself honoured by the visits of so eminent a scholar and philosopher, received him into his house as a learned friend. He was soon afterwards prevailed upon, by a handsome payment which Abelard offered for his board, to admit him into his family; and, apprehending no hazard from a man of Abelard’s age and profession, requested him to undertake the instruction of Heloise. Abelard accepted the trust, but, as it seems, without any other intention than to betray it. The hours of instruction were employed in other lessons than those of learning and philosophy; but Fulberťs respectful opinion of the philosopher, and his partiality for his niece, long concealed from him an amour, which was become the subject of general conversation. Upon discovering her pregnancy, it was thought necessary for her to quit her uncle’s house; and Abelard conveyed her to Bretagne, where his sister was prepared to receive them. Here Heloise was delivered of a son, to whom they gave the whimsical name of Astrolabus. Abelard, upon the birth of the child, proposed to Fulbert to marry his niece, provided the marriage might be kept secret: Fulbert consented, and Abelard returned to Bretagne to fulfil his engagement. Heloise, partly out of regard to the honour of Abelard, whose profession bound him to celibacy, and partly from a romantic notion that love like hers ought not to submit to ordinary restraints, at first gave Abelard a peremptory refusal. He, however, at last prevailed, and they were privately married at Paris. Heloise from this time met with severe treatment from her uncle, which furnished Abelard with a plea for’ removing her from his house, and placing her in the abbey of Benedictine nuns, in which she had been educated. Fulbert concluded, perhaps not without reason, that Abelard had taken this step, in order to rid himself of an encumbrance which obstructed his future prospects. Deep resentment took possession of his soul, and he meditated revenge. He employed several ruffians to enter his chamber by night, and inflict upon his person a disgraceful and cruel mutilation. The deed was perpetrated; the ruffians were taken, and suffered, according to the Lex Talionis, the punishment they had inflicted; and Fulbert, for his savage revenge, was deprived of his benefice, and his goods were confiscated. Unable to support his mortifying reflections, Abelard resolved to retire to a convent. At the same time he formed the selfish resolution, that, since Heloise could no longer be his, she should never be another’s, and ungenerously demanded from her a promise to devote herself to religion; and even insisted upon her taking the holy vow before him, suspecting, as it seems, that if he first engaged himself, she might violate her promise, and return to the world.\n",
      "A few days after Heloise had taken her vows, Abelard assumed the monastic habit in the abbey of St Denys, determined, as it seems, to forget, in hope of being for-* gotten by the world. However, his admirers and scholars in Paris were unwilling that the world should lose the benefit of his labours, and sent deputies to entreat him to return to his school. After some deliberation, he again yielded to the call of ambition; and at a small village in the country, he resumed his lectures, and soon found himself surrounded with a numerous train of scholars. The revival of his popularity renewed the jealousy of other professors, who took the first opportunity of bringing him under ecclesiastical censure. A treatise which he published at this time, entitled, The Theology of Abelard, was supposed to contain some heretical tenets. A synod was called at Soissons in the year 1121; the work was condemned to be burnt, and Abelard was commanded to throw it into the flames. After being involved in other controversies, new charges were brought against him, and he fled to the convent of St Ayoul at Provins in Champagne, the prior of which was his intimate friend. The place of his retreat was soon discovered, and threats and persuasions were in vain employed to recall him: at last he obtained permission to retire to some solitary retreat, on condition that he should never again become a member of a convent.\n",
      "The spot which he chose was a vale in the forest of Champagne, near Nogent upon the Seine. Here Abelard, in 1122, erected a small oratory, which he dedicated to the Trinity, and which he afterwards enlarged, and consecrated to the Third Person, the Comforter, or Paraclete. Here he was soon discovered, and followed by a train of scholars. A rustic college arose in the forest, %nd the number of his pupils soon increased to six hundred. Jealousy again provoked the exertions of his enemies, and he was meditating his escape, when, through the interest of the duke of Bretagne, and with the consent of the abbot of St Denys, he was elected superior of the monastery of St Gildas, in the diocese of «Vannes, where, though not without frequent and grievous vexations, he remained several years.\n",
      "About this time, Suger, the abbot of St Denys, on the plea of an ancient right, obtained a grant for annexing the convent of Argenteuil, of which Heloise was now prioress, to St Denys; and the nuns, who were accused of irregular practices, were dispersed. Abelard, informed of the distressed[7:2:25] situation of Heloise, invited her, with her companions, eight in number, to take possession of the Paraclete. ∙\n",
      "It was during Abelard’s residence-at St Gildas that the interesting correspondence passed between him and He-loise, which is still extant. The letters of Heloisc, in this correspondence, abound with proofs of genius, learning, and taste, which might have graced a better age. It is upon these letters that Mr Pope has formed his celebrated Epistle from Eloisa to Abelard. Here, too, Abelard probably wrote his Theology, which again subjected him to persecution. His opinions were pronounced heretical by a council; and although he appealed to Rome, the judgment of the council was confirmed by the pope; and he was sentenced, unheard, to perpetual silence and imprisonment. By the interposition of some friends, however, and by a submissive apology, he obtained his pardon, with permission to end his days in the monastery of Cluni.\n",
      "At Cluni he was retired, studious, and devout. The monks of the convent importuned him to resume the business of instruction. In a few occasional efforts he complied with their solicitations; and his lectures were heard with undiminished applause. But his health and spirits were much enfeebled, and gradually declined till he died in the 63d year of his age, a. d. 1142. His body was sent to Heloise to be interred in the convent of the Paraclete. Heloise survived her husband 21 years, a pattern of conjugal affection and monastic virtue; and was buried in the same grave. The writings of Abelard will not give the reader a high idea of his genius or taste; but it cannot be questioned, that the man who could foil the first masters of the age at the weapons of logic, draw round him crowded and admiring auditors, and collect scholars from different provinces and countries wherever he chose to form a school, must have possessed extraordinary talents. Had his love of truth been equal to his thirst of fame, and had his courage in adhering to his principles been equal to his ingenuity in defending them, his sufferings and persecutions might have excited more regret, and his title to honourable remembrance would have been better established.\n",
      "His principal works, written in Latin, are, An Address to the Paraclete on the Study of the Scriptures; Problems and Solutions; Sermons on the Festivals; A Treatise against Heresies; An Exposition of the Lord’s Prayer; A Commentary on the Romans; A System of Theology; and his Letters to ∏eloise and to others. Of some of those letters, and the answers, there arc translations in Bonnington's History of the Lives of Abelard and Heloise. The best Latin edition is that of Rawlinson, London, 1716, 8vo.\n",
      "ABELIANS, Abeolites, or Abelonians, in church history, a sect of heretics mentioned by St Austin, which arose in the diocese of Hippo in Africa, and is supposed to have begun in the reign of Arcadius, and ended in that of Theodosius. Indeed it was not calculated for being of any long continuance. Those of this sect regulated marriage after the example of Abel; who, they pretended, was married, but died without ever having known his wife. They therefore allowed each man to marry one woman, but enjoined them to live in continence; and, to keep up the sect, when a man and woman entered into this society, they adopted a boy and a girl, who were to inherit their goods, and to marry upon the same terms of not begetting children, but of adopting two of different sexes.\n",

      "ABERBROTHICK, or Arbroath, a seaport town of Scotland, in the county of Angus, situated at the discharge of the little river Brothic into the sea, as the name imports, Aber in the British implying such a situation. It is a flourishing place, well built, and still increasing. Having been in an improving state for the last forty years, it has now a considerable trade, and employs about 6000 tons of shipping, chiefly in the importation of flax, the raw material of its manufactures; of flax-seed, timber, iron, &c. from the Baltic. The chief employment of the inhabitants is the spinning of flax by machinery, [7:2:26] and its subsequent manufacture into sheetings. A considerable coasting trade is carried on to London and to the ports on the east coast of England, as well as to Leith and the other ports in the frith of Forth. At this place, in default of a natural harbour, an artificial one of piers has been formed, where, at spring tides, which rise here fifteen feet, ships of two hundred tons can come, and of eighty at neap tides; but they must lie dry at low water. Its chief fault is that it is small, and offers no refuge from the German Ocean in easterly storms, though it is cápable of improvement, and, with some expense, might be rendered secure. A battery, which was erected for its defence in 1781, in consequence of an attack from a French privateer, has since been dismantled. This port is of great antiquity: there is an agreement yet extant between the abbot and the burghers of Aberbrothick, in 1194, concerning the making of the harbour. Both parties were bound to contribute their proportions; but the largest fell to the share of the former, for which he was to receive an annual tax payable out of every rood of land lying within the borough. The glory of this place was the abbey, whose very ruins give some idea of its former magnificence. It was founded by William the Lion in 1178, and dedicated to our celebrated primate Thomas a Becket. The founder was buried there; but there are no remains of his tomb, or any other, excepting that of a monk of the name of Alexander Nicol. The monks were of the Tyronensian order; and were first brought from Kelso, whose abbot declared those of this place, on the first institution, to be free from his jurisdiction. The last abbot was the famous Cardinal Beaton, at the same time archbishop of St Andrews, and, before his death, as great and absolute here as Wolsey was in England. King John, the English monarch, granted this monastery most uncommon privileges; for, by charter under the great seal, he exempted it a teloniis et consuetudine in every part of England, except London. At Aberbrothick is a chalybeate water, similar to those of Peterhead and Glendye. The only public buildings worthy of notice, besides the ruins of the abbey, are the parish church and chapels of ease, the town-house, the public schools, and the signal tower which communicates with the Bell Rock light-house at 12 miles distance in the German Ocean. Arbroath is a royal burgh, and unites with Aberdeen, Bervie, Montrose, and Brechin, in sending a member to the British parliament. 58 miles N.N.E. of Edinburgh.

      "ABERCROMBY, The Honourable Alexander (Lord Abercromby), a Judge in the Courts of Session and Justiciary in Scotland, was the youngest son of George Abercromby, of Tullibody, Esq. of a respectable family in Clackmannanshire, and was born on the 15th October 1745. Mr Abercromby was early destined for the profession of the law, and with this view he was educated at the university of Edinburgh, where he passed through the requisite course of languages, philosophy, and law, and was admitted advocate in the year 1766. In 1780 he resigned the office of sheriff-depute of Stirlingshire, which he had held for several years, and accepted of that of depute-advocate, with the hope of extending his employment in the line of his profession. In this step he was not disappointed; for his reputation and business rapidly increased, and soon raised him to the first rank at the Scotch bar. But he still retained a taste for the elegant amusements of polite literature, and was one of that society who set on foot two periodical papers, the Mirror and Lounger, published at Edinburgh; the former in 1779, and the latter in 1785. To the Mirror he contributed ten papers, and to the Lounger nine. The names of the authors have been published in the late editions of these works, which renders it unnecessary to point out those papers of which Mr Abercromby was the author. In May 1792, he was appointed one of the Judges of the Court of Session, and in December following he was called to a seat in the Court of Justiciary. Lord Abercromby continued to discharge the arduous duties of these important offices till summer 1795, when he was seized with a pectoral complaint, of which he died on the 17th November the same year, at Exmouth in Devonshire, where he had gone for the recovery of his health.\n",
      "Abercromby, Sir Ralph, knight of the Bath, arid a lieutenant-general in the British army, an elder brother of the preceding, was born in the year 1738. Being destined for the army, he obtained, in May 1756, a cornet’s commission in the 2d dragoon guards; and rose, April 24. 1762, to the rank of a captain in the 3d regiment of horse. Ascending through the intermediate gradations of rank, he was appointed, November 3. 1781, to the colonelcy of the 103d infantry. September 28. 1787, he was promoted to the rank of major-general. November 5. 1795, he obtained the command of the 7th regiment of dragoons. Having been nearly 40 years in the army, having served with honour in two wars, and being esteemed one of the ablest, coolest, and most intrepid officers in the whole British forces, he was employed on the continent under his Royal Highness the Duke of York, in the commencement of the war against the French republic. In the action on the heights of Cateau, he commanded the advanced guard, and was wounded at Nimeguen. He conducted the march of the guards from Deventer to 01- densal, in the retreat of the British out of Holland, in the winter of 1794-5. In August 1795, he was appointed to succeed Sir Charles Grey, as commander-in-chief of the British forces in the West Indies. March 24.1796, Grenada was suddenly attacked and taken by a detachment of the army under his orders. He afterwards obtained possession of the settlements of Demerara and Essequibo, in South America. St Lucia was next taken by more difficult exertions, in which his ability was signalIy displayed. St Vincent was, by the middle of June, added to the British conquests. Trinidad, in February 1797, shared the same fate. He returned the same year to Europe, and, in reward for such important services, was invested with the red ribbon, appointed to the command of the regiment of Scots Greys, intrusted with the governments of the Isle of Wight, Fort George, and Fort Augustus, and raised to the rank of lieutenant-general. z He held, for a time, the chief command of the forces in Ireland. Iņ that command, he laboured to maintain the discipline of the army, to suppress the rising rebellion, and to protect the people from military oppression, with a care worthy alike of the great general and the enlightened and beneficent statesman. From that station he was called to the chief command of the forces in Scotland. W 7 hen the enterprise against Holland was resolved upon, Sir Ralph Abercromby was called again to command, under his [7:2:27] Royal Highness the Duke of York. The difficulties of the ground, the inclemency of the season, delays, though inconvenient, yet unavoidable, the disorderly movements of the Russians, and the timid duplicity of the Dutch, disappointed our hopes of that expedition. But by the Dutch, the French, the British, it was confessed, that even victory the most decisive could not have more conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer. His country applauded the choice, when, in 1801, he was sent with an army to dispossess the French of Egypt. His experience in Holland and Flanders, and in the climate of the West Indies, particularly fitted him for this new command. He accomplished some of the first duties of a general, in carrying his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite intelligence and supplies, to the destined scene of action. The landing, the first dispositions, the attack, and the superiority over the French which the British infantry under his command evinced, all bear testimony to the high military talents of this commander. It was his fate to fall in the moment of victory. General Lord Hutchinson, who succeeded him in the command, in the dispatches with the account of his death, has given a fine eulogium on his character as a soldier, and strongly expressive of the high estimation in which he was held by the army.—“We have sustained an irreparable loss in the person of our never sufficiently to be lamented commander-in-clιief, Sir Ralph Abercromby, who was mortally wounded in the action, and died on the 28th of March. I believe he was wounded early, but he concealed his situation from those about him, and continued in the field, giving his orders with that coolness and perspicuity which had ever marked his character, till long after the action was over, when he fainted through weakness and loss of blood. Were it permitted for a soldier to regret any one who has fallen in the service of his country, I might be excused for lamenting him more than any other person; but it is some consolation to those who tenderly loved him, that, as his life was honourable, so was his death glorious. His memory will be recorded in the annals of his country—will be sacred to every British soldier—and embalmed in the recollection of a grateful posterity.” His remains were conveyed on board Admiral Lord Keith’s flag-ship to Malta, attended by Colonel Sir John Dyer, and were interred in the commandery of the grand master, with the highest military honours. A monument to his memory was erected in St Paul’s church, London, in pursuance of a vote of the House of Commons. His widow was created a peeress, and a pension of L.2000 a-year for her and three lives settled on the family. ( Gent. Mag.')\n",
      "ABERDEEN, Old, is a place of great antiquity. According to tradition, it was of note in the reign of Gregory, who conferred on it some privileges about the yċar 898. In 1004, VJalcolm II. founded a bishopric at a place called Mortlich in Banffshire, in memory of a signal victory which he there gained over the Danes: which bishopric, was translated to Old Aberdeen by David I.; and in 1153, the then bishop of Aberdeen obtained a new charter from Malcolm IV. There is extant a charter of Alexander II. by which, in 1217, the king grants to Aberdeen the same privileges he had granted to his town of Perth. The town lies about a mile to the north of the New Town, at the mouth of the river Don, over which is a fine Gothic bridge, of a single arch, greatly admired, which rests on a rock on each side. This arch, said to have been built by a bishop of Aberdeen about the year 1290, is 67 feet wide at the bottom, and 34½ feet high above the surface of the river, which at ebb tide is here 19 feet deep. This town, which consists chiefly of one long street, was formerly the seat of the bishop, and had a large cathedral commonly called St Machar’s. Two very antique and lofty spires of stone, and the nave, which is used as a church, are now the only remains of it. They are finely, ornamented, and are in a state of complete repair. The bishopric was founded in the time of David I. as above mentioned. The cathedral had anciently two rows of stone pillars across the church, and three turrets; the steeple, which was the largest of these turrets, rested upon an arch, supported by four pillars. In this cathedral there was a fine library; but about the year 1560, it was almost totally destroyed. But the capital building is the King’s College, on the south side of the town, which is a large and stately fabric. It is built in form of a square, with cloisters on the south side. The chapel is very ruinous within; but there still remains some wood work of exquisite workmanship. This was preserved by the spirit of the principal at the time of the Reformation, who armed his people, and checked the blind zeal of the barons of the Mearns; who, after stripping the cathedral of its roof, and robbing it of the bells, were about to violate this seat of learning. The steeple is vaulted with a double cross arch; above which is an imperial crown, supported by eight stone pillars, and closed with a globe and two gilded crosses. In the year 1631, this steeple was thrown down by a storm, but was soon after rebuilt in a more stately íbrm. This college was founded in 1494, by William Elphinston, bishop of this place, lord chancellor of Scotland in the reign of James HI. and lord privy seal in that of James IV. But James IV. claimed the patronage of it, and it has since been called the Kings College. The library is considerable, but not remarkable for curiosities. Hector Boethius was the first principal of the college, and was sent for from Paris for that purpose, on an annual salary of forty merks Seots, at thirteen pence each. The square tower on the side of the college was built by contributions from General Monk and the officers under him then quartered at Aberdeen, for the reception of students. The professorships are Divinity, Medicine, Civil Law, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Greek, Humanity, and Oriental Languages; and there are numerous bursaries for the poorer students. Population, by the last return, 1483.\n",
      "ABERDEEN, New, a considerable seaport, and capital of the county of Aberdeen. It is situated on the German Ocean, at the mouth of the river Dec, and in point of population, wealth, and commerce, ranks as the chief town in the north of Scotland. In 1800, an act was obtained for the general improvement of the city; and since this period its whole appearance and plan have been changed. New and spacious streets have been opened, bridges of communication have been built, and other improvements executed, ornamental as well as useful. Union Street, which affords a splendid access from the south and west, extends from the market-place 1350 yards, and is 70 feet wide The houses are built of dressed granite; and when the street is completely filled up, it will present a fine appearance. To facilitate the access into the town by means of this street, an elegant bridge, of a single arch, the span of which is 132 feet, has been erected at an expense of L.10,000. A new opening to the north has been made by King’s Street; and on the line of this street there is also a bridge over the river Don, of five arches, each of 75 feet, which has been constructed at an expense of L.14,000. Since 1800, numerous other new streets have been opened, and many of them nearly completed. In consequence of these improvements, Aberdeen may be considered as a spacious, elegant, and well-built city. The public buildings are numerous. There are about 30 places for divine worship. Connected with the established [7:2:28] religion are the East and West churches, forming one continued building 170 feet in length, and adorned with a spire 150 feet in height; besides seven chapels of ease. St Andrew’s church is an elegant new building, constructed of freestone. There are three episcopal chapels; five meeting-houses for seceders; eight congregational and baptists; one methodist meeting-house; a Roman Catholic chapel, in which there is a good organ; a quaker meetinghouse; two meeting-houses for relief people; and four for independents.\n",
      "The charitable institutions are numerous. The infirmary is a large and commodious building, for the reception and cure of the diseased poor, and has lately received considerable additions. The managers were incorporated by royal charter in 1773. It has extensive funds, derived from donations, bequests, and periodical contributions. The lunatic asylum was opened in 1800, and is under the same management as the infirmary. A large and elegant building has lately been added to the original house, and ample accommodation is now afforded to all the various classes of lunatics. There is a poor-house for the relief of the indigent, the maintenance and education of destitute children and orphans. Gordon’s hospital, for the maintenance of 90 boys, the sons of decayed burgesses, is a handsome building, with a good statue of the founder in front. A large addition is about to be made to this institution, in consequence of a magnificent legacy lately received. There are two schools, one for boys and the other for girls, on the Lancasterian plan. There is also another for the education of the deaf and dumb. In addition to these, there are various other schools and seminaries, which are supported by subscriptions, donations, and bequests. There are ample funds of the seven incorporated trades for the support of decayed members, widows, and orphans.\n",
      "The college called Marischal College was founded by George Keith, earl marshal, in the year 1593. It has a library containing about 11,000 volumes, an observatory, and an excellent apparatus of philosophical instruments attached to the class of natural philosophy. The languages, mathematics, moral and natural philosophy, natural history, and medicine, are taught here. The other public buildings are the town-house and old tolbooth, which stands on the north side of the market-place, and which is surmounted by a handsome spire 120 feet high; behind which, and connected with it, has lately been erected the new court-house, which combines the advantages of elegance, convenience, and comfort. In the square, and fronting the town-house, stands the cross. It is adorned with busts cut in stone of the royal family of Scotland, from James I. to James VII. inclusive. The assembly-rooms, in Union Street, were built in 1821, by subscription. They are constructed of beautiful granite, handsomely ornamented. The rooms, which are 90 feet in front, and 156 feet at the back of the edifice, are splendidly finished in the interior. There are military barracks, which were erected in 1796; a bridewell, opened in 1809; and a neat theatre.\n",
      "The commerce and manufactures of Aberdeen are extensive and flourishing. One of the most important branches of manufacture is the cotton, which was introduced about the year 1779, and has given rise to some very great establishments, in some of which steam-engines are employed. There are other smaller works, which manufacture stripes, winseys, druggets, &c. The whole give employment to about 4000 hands. There are four large woollen manufactories, three of which are moved by water, and the other, being the most extensive, by steam. In these are manufactured superfine broad and narrow cloths, blankets and serges, stockings, worsted yarns, &c. The manufacture of carpeting, chiefly for the London and American markets, has been introduced within these few years. The linen manufacture, particularly that of thread, is carried on in all its branches to a great extent. There are several breweries, in which porter and ales are made; and considerable quantities are annually exported to America and the West Indies. There are also several distilleries, the number of which has been increased since the late reduction of the duty on spirits. Of late years some extensive iron-works have been established, in which are manufactured ships’ anchors, chain-cables, steam-engines, spinning machinery, locks, hinges, &c. The proprietors of these works also built a large steam-vessel of 564 tons burden. There are manufactures of soap, candles, leather, &c. The granite stones; so famous for their durability and strength, which are quarried, dressed, and shipped from this port, form a staple commodity for exportation, and are a great source of wealth to the place, by giving employment to many thousands of industrious labourers. These stones are chiefly used for paving streets; for building bridges, wharfs, and docks; for erecting light-houses, &c. There are six banking establishments in the town.\n",
      "The vessels which belong to the port of Aberdeen amount to 218, carrying 33,572 tons burden. They trade to North and South America, the West Indies, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Greenland, Davis’ Straits, and most of the ports of the united kingdom. Ship-building is carried on to a great extent, and gives employment to numerous hands. The want of any proper harbour was long a detriment to the trade of Aberdeen, and occasioned the loss of many lives, and of much property. It was narrow at the mouth, and being exposed in easterly storms to the surf from the German Ocean, a bar of sand was raised quite across, on which, at low water, there was not occasionally above three feet of water. To remedy this defect a pier was built in 1776, by Smcaton, on the north side of it, which extended a considerable way into the German Ocean; and by an act obtained in 1810, it was still farther enlarged. This extensive quay is built of large masses of dressed granite, and measures in length 2300 yards. In consequence of this improvement they have now, a little to the south of the bar, a depth of 17 fathoms at low water, and at the bar from 8 to 9 fathoms, where they had formerly a few feet. The harbour is at present (1829) undergoing some important improvements, by the construction of wet and dry docks, the extension of the quay, &c. for which purpose a new act was lately obtained from the legislature.\n",
      "Aberdeen is a place of antiquity, its records being preserved from the time of William the Lion, a. d. 1214. From the beginning of the 15th century the journals of the magistrates and town-council came down in a regular series. In the 13th century Aberdeen was a commercial place, and soon grew to be of some note. It suffered occasionally from the casualties and calamities incident to the almost continued warfare of that rude age. About the beginning of the 14th century an English garrison occupied the castle of Aberdeen. But this stronghold was taken by a sudden rising of the citizens, and the English troops were all put to the sword. In 1333 and 1336 the town was burnt by a fleet of Edward III.; it was speedily afterwards rebuilt, and was afterwards known by the name of New Aberdeen. It unites with the burghs of Bervie, Brechin, Montrose, and Arbroath, in sending a representative to parliament.

      "ABERDEENSHIRE, a county in Scotland, situate in the north-east, between 56. 52. and 57. 42. north latitude, and between 1. 49. and 3. 48. of longitude west from Greenwich. It is bounded by the German Ocean on the north and east; by the counties of Kincardine, Forfar, and Perth, on the south; and by those of Inverness, Moray, and Banff, on the west. Its greatest length is 85, arid breadth 40 miles; the bounding line being about 280 miles, of which 60 are on the sea-coast. By a careful measurement of Arrowsmith’s map, it is found to contain 1960 square miles, an area equal to 1,254,400 English or 994,520 Scotch acres; of which somewhat more than one-third is under cultivation. It contains 85 parishes, and is usually described under five divisions. First, Marr, which is a mountainous district, particularly Braemar, the highland part of it; few of the bounding mountains being less than 3000 feet, and several of them more than 4000 feet above the level of the sea. Red deer are here found in great numbers, sometimes 300 in a flock; and moor game abounds in this as in all the more elevated parts of the county. Second, Formartin, of which the land on the sea-coast is low and fertile; but hills and mosses are spread over the interior. Third, Euchan, the most extensive division next to Marr, having a bold precipitous shore of 50 miles, but generally a flat surface, the soil of which has been greatly improved of late by the cultivation of turnips and clover. The Bullers of Buchan, about 6 miles south from Peterhead, is a natural curiosity, which has been often described by tourists. Fourth, Garioch, a large and beautiful valley, naturally very fertile. Before the introduction of modern husbandry, it was termed the granary of Aberdeen. And, fifth, Strathbogie, the greater part of which consists of hills, mosses, and moors. On a comprehensive review, it may be said, that, with the exception of the low grounds of Buchan, and the highlands of the south-west division, Aberdeenshire consists for the most part of tracks nearly level, but often bleak, naked, and unfertile, though interspersed with many rich spots in a high state of cultivation. In extent, it is very nearly one-sixteenth part of Scotland.\n",
      "Aberdeenshire is not rich in mineral productions. No coal has been found in it, and limestone, though it exists in many parts, is by no means abundant. Slatè quarries are wrought to a small extent on the hill of Foudland, in the Garioch division; manganese is found near Aberdeen; and black lead has been discovered in the neighbourhood of Huntly. The mountains of Braemar contain those precious stones called Cairηgοηιms by the country people, who go thither in whole families to search for them during the summer season; they are sold, sometimes at high prices, chiefly to the London jewellers. But granite is the most abundant mineral, and has brought considerable sums into the county, besides supplying the inhabitants with excellent stones, for building and other purposes. As many stones have been raised from an acre of land under preparation for tillage, as brought from L.30 to L.50, for paving the streets of London. The exportation of granite to the capital employed at one time about 70 vessels of 7000 tons, and 400 men; and the value of all the stones exported yearly was stated at L.40,000.\n",
      "The principal rivers are the Dee and the Don. The gross annual produce of the salmon-fisheries on these two rivers was estimated a few years ago at nearly L.35,000. The Ythan and Ugic within the county, and the Deveron and Bogie on its boundaries, are also considerable streams. Muscles are plentiful near the mouth of the Ythan; and pearl muscles have been sometimes discovered at its lower extremity. One of the jewels of the ancient crown of Scotland, a valuable pearl, is said to have been found here.\n",
      "There are also several lakes well stored with pike, trout, eels, and other kinds of fish. The county is noted for its chalybeate springs at Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and at Pan-anich on the Dee.\n",
      "The climate of Aberdeenshire, except in the mountainous districts, is rendered comparatively mild by its being bounded on two sides by the sea. The winters are not so severe as in some of the southern counties, but the springs are late, owing to the prevalence of easterly winds; and in autumn the weather is often wet and stormy. Wheat, however, and all the other crops cultivated in Scotland, come to perfection; and the inhabitants, who are not subject to any local diseases, sometimes live to a great age.\n",
      "The district of Marr, containing almost half the county, abounds in natural woods, which are a source of wealth to their proprietors, and of profitable employment to the inhabitants. This country is so well adapted to the growth of trees, that it is only necessary to shut out the cattle by inclosures, and the birds and winds supply it with seeds that soon rise into vigorous plants. These woods consist chiefly of Scotch fir; and the timber, especially what grows in the forests of Braemar, has been thought superior to any that Scotland has imported from the north of Europe. About a tenth part of the whole surface of the county is under wood; and the trees found in the peat mosses indicate the existence of still more extensive forests in former ages.\n",
      "Ruins of ancient edifices are seen in different parts of the county. In the Garioch district, the vitrified fort called Dun-o-Deer, built on the summit of a beautiful conical hill, which springs about 300 feet from its base, is supposed to be 1000 years old; and is said to have been the residence of King Gregory the Great (as he is called by the old Scotish historians), who died in 892. The ruins of two buildings, supposed to have belonged to Malcolm Kenmore, who died in 1004, arc still pointed out. One of them, situate at Castletown of Braemar, was his hunting seat; the other stands in a small island in Loch Kanders, and must have been inaccessible, except when the lake was frozen. A wooden bridge, which connected it with the land, has been found in the lake. The castle of Kil-drummy, which in 1150 was the property of Daγid Earl of Huntingdon, must have been a princely edifice, covering nearly an acre of ground; and its venerable remains still show the power and grandeur of the chieftains by whom it was inhabited. In the same district are some ancient subterraneous retreats, supposed to have been used by the Picts as places of refuge from an invading enemy.\n",
      "The agriculture of Aberdeenshire has been considerably improved of late years; potatoes, turnips, and clover, as well as wheat and other crops, arc now cultivated according to the best courses of modern husbandry. Farms, however, are still generally of a small size, compared with those of the south-eastern counties; and the buildings, though gradually improving, are for the most part much less convenient and comfortable. Here, as in every other part of Scotland, a lease for nineteen years is the most common bond of connection between the landholder and farmer; but it would appear that the covenants of leases are still in a considerable degree dictated by feudal ideas.\n",
      "In most parts of Aberdeenshire, cattle are a more important object to the tenantry than corn; the number is stated at 110,000; and the sales, to England and to the south of Scotland, amounting to about 12,000, were estimated some years ago to bring L.150,000 annually. About two-thirds of the population depend entirely on agriculture; oatmeal, prepared in different ways, with potatoes, is the principal food of the labouring classes.\n",
      "Besides the salmon-fisheries already noticed, the sea [7:2:30] fishing employs a number of hands. The Greenland whale-fishery is carried on with great success, by ships fitted out from Aberdeen and Peterhead. The whole fisheries connected with the county are said to yield from L.80,000 to L.100,000 annually.\n",
      "The old staple manufacture, the knitting of stockings, has declined considerably for several years; but those in wool, cotton, and flax, are upon an extensive scale, and employ a large proportion of the inhabitants. There are also establishments for making sail-cloth, inkle, paper, &c.; and, from the characteristic ingenuity and enterprise of the people, Aberdeenshire may soon assume a still higher rank among the manufacturing counties of Britain.\n",
      "A share of our foreign trade, chiefly with the north of Europe, has been long enjoyed by this county, and the ~ecent improvements on the harbour of Aberdeen must contribute essentially to the extension of its commerce. There were, in 1810, belonging to Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Newburgh, 207 vessels, carrying 23,390 tons, and employing 1473 men. In 1807 a canal was opened from the harbour of Aberdeen to the town of Inverury, a distance of 18½ miles, the expense of which was about L.44,000. The facilities which this canal affords for the conveyance of coal and lime have already proved highly beneficial to the agriculture of the county.\n",
      "The valued rent of the county is L.235,665. 8s. lid.\n",
      "Scots; but the real rent for the lands and houses is probably not less than L.300,000 sterling.\n",
      "The principal seats in Aberdeenshire are, Aboyne Castle, the Earl of Aboyne; Ellon Castle and Haddo House, the Earl of Aberdeen; Huntly Lodge, the Duke of Gordon; Keith Hall, the Earl of Kintore; Marr Lodge, the Earl of Fife; Philorth House, Lord Saltoun; Pitfour, Ferguson; Castle Forbes, Lord Forbes; Skene House, Skene; Slaines Castle, the Earl of Errol. The prevailing names among the proprietors are, Gordon, Forbes, Grant, Fraser, Duff, and Ferguson. The county sends one member to parliament, and its three royal boroughs, Aberdeen, Kintore, and Inverury, have a share in the election of other two; Aberdeen, with other four boroughs in the adjoining counties, returning one, and Kintore and Inver - ury, along with other three, another member.\n",
      "In the returns made under the population acts, the county is divided into eight districts, viz. Aberdeen, Alford, Deer or Buchan, Ellon, Garioch, Kincardine O’Neil, Strathbogie, and Turreff. The following table shows the number of inhabitants at each of the three census made under these acts. In this, as in the other maritime counties of the north, there is a considerable disproportion between the number of the sexes. The increase from 1801 to 1811, is at the rate of 9½ per cent.; from 1811 to 1821, 15; and from 1801 to 1821, 26½ per cent.\n",

      "ABERDOUR, a small town in Fifeshire, Scotland, on the northern shore of the frith of Forth, about ten miles north-west of Edinburgh, with which there is now a frequent and easy communication by steam-boats. In old times it belonged to the Viponts; in 1126 it was transferred to the Mortimers by marriage, and afterwards to the Douglases. William, lord of Liddesdale, surnamed the Flower of Chivalry, in the reign of David II. by charter conveyed it to James Douglas, ancestor of the present noble owner, the earl of Morton. The monks of Inchcolm had a grant for a burial-place here from Allan de Mortimer, in the reign of Alexander III. The nuns, usually styled the Poor Clares, had a convent at this place. It is a pleasantly situated town, and is greatly resorted to in summer for sea-bathing. Coarse cloths are manufactured to a small extent in the village.\n",

      "ABERNETHY, John, an eminent dissenting minister, was the son of Mr John Abernethy, a dissenting minister in Coleraine, and was born there on the 19th of October 1680. When about nine years of age he was separated from his parents, his father being obliged to attend some public affairs in London; and his mother, to shelter herself from the mad fury of the Irish rebels, retiring to Derry, a relation who had him under his care, having no opportunity of conveying him to her, carried him to Scotland; and thus he escaped the hardships and dangers of the siege of Derry, in which Mrs Abernethy lost all her other children. He afterwards studied at the university of Glasgow, where he remained till he took the degree of master of arts; and, in 1708, he was chosen minister of a dissenting congregation at Antrim, in which situation he continued above 20 years. About the time of the Bangorian controversy (for which see Hoadley), a dissension arose among his brethren in the ministry at Belfast, on the subject of subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith. In this controversy he became a leader on the negative side, and incurred the censure of [7:2:31] a general synod. The agitation of parties began to be also felt among the members of his congregation. Many of them deserted him; which induced him to accept of an invitation to settle in Dublin, where his preaching was ’much admired. Here he continued for ten years, respected and esteemed. But his labours were terminated by a sudden attack of the gout in the head, to which he had been subject; and he died in December 1740, in the 60th year of his age. His writings, like his character, are distinguished for candour, liberality, and manly sentiment. He published a volume of sermons on the Divine Attributes; after his death a second volume was published by his friends; and these were succeeded by four other volumes on different subjects, all of which have been greatly admired.\n",
      "ABERNETHY, a town of Scotland, in Perthshire, situated at a short distance to the southward of the right bank of the river Tay, a little above the mouth of the Eame. It is of very ancient date, and is said to have been the seat of the Pictish kings; and there are some uncertain traditions of its existence prior to this period. It is distinguished by a curious piece of antiquity; namely, a circular tower 74 feet high and 16 in diameter, consisting of 64 courses of hewn stone. It continued long to be the see of an archbishop, which was afterwards transferred to St Andrews. The inhabitants are engaged in the manufacture of linen. The population in 1821 was 1701. 7 miles from Perth.\n",
      "ABERRATION, in Astronomy, a remarkable phenomenon, by which all the stars appear, at certain seasons of the year, to deviate in a slight degree from their true situation in the heavens, in consequence, as is now ascertained, of the motion of the light from every star combining itself with the motion in the eye of the observer, caused by the earth’s annual revolution round the sun. All vision, it is well known, is performed by the particles or rays of light from any object striking agaiηst the eye, and the object invariably appears in that direction in which the rays finally impinge. Hence, for example, arise the effects of refraction, by which the heavenly bodies appear more elevated in the horizon than they really are; the rays of light, as they penetrate the atmosphere, bending gradually downwards towards the surface of the earth, so as at last to reach the eye of the spectator in a direction more inclined from the horizon than that in which they issue from the object: and thus the latter appears more elevated in the sky than it really is, as in the annexed sketch.\n",
      "In a similar manner the rays of light which fall directly from the stars, in certain circumstances, owing to the motion őf the earth, really impinge on the eye of a spectator in a direction somewhat oblique, so that they appear on this account in a situation different from what they really occupy; and this constitutes the aberration. Suppose, for example, the earth is moving in a direction at right angles to that of the light from any star, then it is evident there astronomer Roemer, regarding the successive propagation of light, as found by the observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites at different seasons of the year, it appears that light actually employs about 15 minutes to travel from the one circumference to the other of the earth’s orbit; and from other still more accurate observations, its velocity has been determined at about 194,000 miles per second, while the mean velocity of the earth in her orbit does not exceed 19 miles. Hence it is easy to calculate that the aberration in this case will amount to an angle of about 20\" of a degree; and this case in which the earth’s motion is perpendicular to that of the light is that in which the aberration is the greatest of all; for, as the motion of the earth becomes oblique to that of the light, the aberration gradually diminishes, until at last it disappears altogether, when the two motions become in one straight line, that is, when the earth is moving either directly from or directly towards the stars. In all cases the apparent direction of the stars will be in the diagonal of the parallelogram, the sides of which represent the direction and the relative motions of the light and of the earth.\n",
      "The aberration of light having been discovered by means of the telescope, this has given rise to a familiar illustration of the subject, which it may be proper to state. It is evident, that before the star can be visible in the telescope, the light in its progress through it must be continually in the axis. Were the telescope, therefore, affected with any considerable lateral motion, this could not take place if the telescope were held directly up to the star; because, though the light might enter the telescope in the axis, the lateral motion would quickly withdraw the axis from the line of the light, which would strike against the side of the telescope and never reach the eye. If, for example, the light moved successively will be a mutual collision between them; the light will not only strike the eye of a spectator, but the eye will also strike the light; the effect will be exactly the same' as if the eye had been at rest, and the light had been endowed with an equal motion in the contrary direction; so that in addition to its direct motion, it has also a slight motion laterally; and the true direction of the impact, therefore, or of the compound motion of the light, according to the well-known laws of the composition of forces, will be the diagonal of the rectangle, the sides of which represent the directions and velocities of the light and of the eye, as in the annexed sketch, where S E represents the direction and velocity of the light, F E the direction and velocity of the motion of the earth, and E F, therefore, the direction and velocity of the contrary motion in the light, the earth being supposed at rest. When the light arrives at the eye therefore at E, it has not only the direct motion S E or E G, which is made by construction equal to S E, but also a lateral motion E F; so that the compound motion will be represented by the diagonal E H, which is the true direction in which the light will really impinge on the eye; so that the star, instead of appearing at S, will appear at s, as far in advance of its true position as the earth has moved in the time the light travels from the star to the eye. To determine the amount of this aberration, therefore, we have only to compare the motion of light with that of the earth in its orbit. Now, from the celebrated discovery of the Danish [7:2:32] to the points A, B, C, D, E, while the telescope or tube moved successively parallel to itself into the positions E A, Vf> θ5S Hä, Ĩİĵ then\n",
      "∖ the light entering at A, by the time it reaches B the tube is off into the position F f and by B the time it could reach E the tube is removed to I i ; so that it is evident the star will not be θ visible at all in the true direction of the light. In order that this may ŋ always remain in the lj telescope, and traverse it from end to end, this must be set in the position E i, oblique to E A; then the light entering at i, Fig. 2. will advance to b in the same time that the axis of the tube advances parallel to itself to F f ; so that the light will still remain in the axis. In the same manner the light and the tube will continue to advance by proportional steps till the former reaches the eye, where the star will appear in the direction of the tube, and that as formerly in the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the directions and velocities of the two motions. Another illustration was suggested by Clairaut in the Mémoires de ľ Académie des Sciences for the year 1746, by supposing drops of rain to fall rapidly and quickly after each other from a cloud, under which a person moves with a very narrow tube; in which case, it is evident that the tube must have a certain inclination, in order that a drop which enters at the top may fall freely through the axis of the tube, without touching the sides of it; which inclination must be more or less, according to the velocity of the drops in respect to that of the tube: then the angle made by the direction of the tube and of the falling drops is the aberration arising from the combination of those two motions.\n",
      "In all cases it will be observed the aberration takes place in the direction of the earth’s motion. Hence it is easy to deduce, from what we have stated, the effects on the different stars. Consider, for example, those situated in the pole of the ecliptic. To the rays of light from these, the earth’s motion will always be at right angles; the aberration on them, therefore, will always be of the same amount, viz. about 20\"; but as the earth changes the direction of its motion along the ecliptic, the aberration will change its direction also, so that the star will appear to move in a little orbit, similar to, and parallel with the ecliptic; the apparent situation of the star revolving annually round the true place, as the earth revolves round the sun. Consider again the stars situated in the plane of the ecliptic. To the rays of light from these, the earth’s motion will be at one time at right angles, as at A and B in the annexed sketch, and at another in the same direction, as at C and D; for in all these cases we may hold the dimensions of the earth’s orbit as nothing compared with the distance of the star. At A, therefore, the earth being supposed to move in the direction A D B, so as to make the star appear at a, the aberration will be 20\" in the direction S a, and at B 20\" in' the direction S b, so as to make the star appear atð, while at C and D it will be nothing, and the star will appear in its true place at S. The apparent situation will, therefore, appear annually to oscillate on each side of the true, to the extent of 20\". Between the two extremes therefore, namely, the pole of the ecliptic, where the aberration causes the star to revolve in a circle, and the plane of the ecliptic, where it causes it to oscillate in a straight line, the stars will all describe elliptic curves, elongated 40\" in a direction parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, and the breadth or lesser axis diminishing continually from the pole towards the plane of the ecliptic, where the curve passes into a straight line. These motions in the stars are confirmed by the observations of astronomers, (see Astronomy,) and they furnish one among many other beautiful examples of that remarkable and perfect accordance which in this science subsists everywhere between theory and fact. The effects of aberration also present a striking, and one of the few direct proofs which astronomy furnishes of the motion of the earth, these being quite unaccountable on any other hypothesis.\n",
      "buch are the principal phenomena of aberration. This great discovery, one of the finest in modern astronomy, we owe to the accuracy and ingenuity of the distinguished astronomer Dr Bradley, who was led to it in the year 1727, by the result of some observations which he made, with a view of determining the annual parallax of the fixed stars. See Parallax.\n",
      "The annual motion of the earth about the sun had been much doubted and warmly contested. The defenders of that motion, among other proofs of the reality of it, conceived the idea of adducing an incontestible one from the annual parallax of the fixed stars, if the stars should be within such a distance, or if instruments and observations could be made with such accuracy, as to render that parallax sensible. And with this view various attempts have been made. Before the observations of Μ. Picard, made in 1672, it was the general opinion that the stars did not change their position during the course of a year. Tycho Brahe and Ricciolus fancied that they had assured themselves of it from their observations; and from thence they concluded that the earth did not move round the sun, and that there was no annual parallax in the fixed stars. Μ. Picard, in the account of his Voyage d , Uranibourg, made in 1672, says that the pole star, at different times of the year, has certain variations, which he had observed for about 10 years, and which amounted to about 40\" a year: from whence some, who favoured the annual motion of the earth, were led to conclude that these variations were the effect of the parallax of the earth’s orbit. But it was impossible to explain it by that parallax, because this motion was in a manner contrary to what ought to follow only from the motion of the earth in her orbit.\n",
      "In 1674 Dr Hooke published an account of observations which he said he had made in 1669, and by which he had found that the star γ Draconis was 23\" more northerly in July than in October; observations which, for the present, seemed to favour the opinion of the earth’s motion, although it be now known that there could not be any truth or accuracy in them.\n",
      "Flamsteed having observed the pole star with his mural quadrant, in 1680 and the following years, found that its declination was 40\" less in July than in December; which observations, although very just, were yet, however, improper for proving the annual parallax; and he recαm-mended[7:2:33] the making of an instrument of 15 or 20 feet radius, to be firmly fixed on a strong foundation, for deciding a doubt which was otherwise not soon likely to be brought to a conclusion.\n",
      "In this state of uncertainty and doubt, then, Dr Bradley, in conjunction with Mr Samuel Molineux, in the year 1725, formed the project of verifying, by a series of new observations, those which Dr Hook had communicated to the public almost 50 years before. And as it was his attempt that chiefly gave rise to this, so it was his method in making the observations, in some measure, that they followed; for they made choice of the same star, and their instrument was constructed upon nearly the same principles: but had it not greatly exceeded the former in exactness, they might still have continued in great uncertainty as to the parallax of the fixed stars. For this, and many other convenient and useful astronomical instruments, philosophers arc indebted to the ingenuity and accuracy of Mr Graham.\n",
      "The success of the experiment evidently depending so much on the accuracy of the instrument, this became a leading object of consideration. Mr Molineux’s apparatus then having been completed, and fitted for observing, about the end of November 1725, on the third day of December following, the bright star in the head of Draco, marked γ by Bayer, was for the first time observed, as it passed near the zenith, and its situation carefully taken with the instrument. The like observations were made on the fifth, eleventh, and twelfth days of the same month; and there appearing no material diffcrenee in the place of the star, a further repetition of them, at that season, seemed needless, it being a time of the year in·which no sensible alteration of parallax, in this star, could soon be expected. It was therefore curiosity that chiefly urged Dr Bradley, who was then at Kew, where the instrument was fixed, to prepare for observing the star again on the 17th of the same month; when,.having adjusted the instrument as usual, he perceived that it passed a little more southerly this day than it had done before. Not suspecting any other cause of this appearance, it was ascribed to the uncertainty of the observations, and that either this or the foregoing was not so exact as had been supposed. For which reason they proposed to repeat the observation again, to determine from what cause this difference might proceed: and upon doing it, on the 20th of December, the doctor found that the star passed still more southerly than at the preceding observation. This sensible alteration surprised them the more, as it was the contrary way from what it would have been had it proceeded from an annual parallax of the star. But being now pretty well satisfied that it could not be entirely owing to the want of accuracy in the observations, and having no notion of any thing else that could cause such an apparent motion as this in the star, they began to suspect that some change in the materials or fabric of the instrument itself might have occasioned it. Under these uncertainties they remained for some time; but being at length fully convinced, by several trials, of the great exactness of the instrument, and finding, by the gradual increase of the star’s distance from the pole, that there must be some regular cause that produced it, they took care to examine very nicely, at the time of each observation, how much the variation was; till about the beginning of March 1726, the star was found to be 20\" more southerly than at the time of the first observation: it now indeed seemed to have arrived at its utmost limit southward, as in several trials, made about this time, no sensible difference was observed in its situation. By the middle of April it appeared to be returning back again towards the north; and about the beginning of June it passed at the same distance from the zenith as it had done in December, when it was first observed.\n",
      "From the quick alteration in the declination of the star at this time, increasing about one second in three days, it was conjectured that it would now proceed northward, as it had before gone southward, of its present situation; and it happened accordingly; for the star continued to move northward till September following, when it again became stationary; being then near 20\" more northerly than in June, and upwards of 39\" more northerly than it had been in March. From September the star again returned towards the south, till, in December, it arrived at the same situation in which it had been observed twelve months before, allowing for the difference of declination on account of the precession of the equinox.\n",
      "This was a sufficient proof that the instrument had not been the cause of this apparent motion of the star; and yet it seemed difficult to devise one that should be adequate to such an unusual effect. A nutation of the earth’s axis was one of the first things that offered itself on this occasion; but it was soon found to be insufficient; for though it might have accounted for the change of declination in γ Draconis, yet it would not at the same time accord with the phenomena observed in the other stars, particularly in a small one almost opposite in right ascension to γ Draconis, and at about the same distance from the north pole of the equator: for though this star seemed to move the same way as a nutation of the earth’s axis would have made it, yet changing its declination but about half as much as γ Draconis in the same time, as appeared on comparing the observations of both made on the same -days, at different seasons of the year, this plainly proved that the apparent motion of the star was not occasioned by a real nutation; for had this been the case, the alteration in both stars would have been nearly equal.\n",
      "The great regularity of the observations left no room to doubt, but that there was some uniform cause by which this unexpected motion was produced, and which did not depend on the uncertainty or variety of the seasons of the year. Upon comparing the observations with each other, it was discovered that, in both the stars above mentioned, the apparent difference of declination from the maxima was always nearly proportional to the versed sine of the sun’s distance from the equinoctial points. This was an inducement to think that the cause, whatever it was, had some relation to the sun’s situation with respect to those points. But not being able to frame any hypothesis sufficient to account for all the phenomena, and being very desirous to search a little further into this matter, Dr Bradley began to think of erecting an instrument for himself at Wanstead; that, having it always at hand, he might with the more ease and certainty inquire into the laws of this new motion. The consideration likewise of being able, by another instrument, to conform the truth of the observations hitherto made with that of Mr Moli-neux, was no small inducement to the undertaking; but the chief of all was, the opportunity he should thereby have of trying in what manner other stars should be affected by the same cause, whatever it might be. For Mr Molineux’s instrument being originally designed for observing γ Draconis, to try whether it had any sensible parallax, it was so contrived as to be capable of but little alteration in its direction; not above seven or eight minutes of a degree: and there being but few stars within half that distance from the zenith of Kew bright enough to be well observed, he could not, with his instrument, thoroughly examine how this cause affected stars that [7:2:34] were differently situated with respect to the equinoctial and solstitial points of the ecliptic.\n",
      "These considerations determined him; and by the contrivance and direction of the same ingenious person, Mr Graham, his instrument was fixed up the 19th of August 1727. As he had no convenient place where he could make use of so long a telescope as Mr Molineux’s, he contented himself with one of but little more than half the length, namely of 12 feet and a half, the other being 24 feet and a half long, judging from the experience he had already had, that this radius would be long enough to adjust the instrument to a sufficient degree of exactness: and he had no reason afterwards to change his opinion; for by all his trials he was very well satisfied, that when it was carefully rectified, its situation might be securely depended on to half a second. As the place where his instrument was hung in some measure determined its radius, so did it also the length of the arc or limb, on which the divisions were made, to adjust it; for the arc could not conveniently be extended farther, than to reach to about 6½ degrees on each side of the zenith. This however was sufficient, as it gave him an opportunity of making choice of several stars, very different both in magnitude and situation; there being more than two hundred, inserted in the British Catalogue, that might be observed with it. He needed not, indeed, to have extended the limb so far, but that he was willing to take in Capeüa, the only star of the first magnitude that came so near his zenith.\n",
      "His instrument being fixed, he immediately began to observe such stars as he judged most proper to give him any light into the cause of the motion already mentioned. There was a sufficient variety of small ones, and not less than twelve that he could observe through all seasons of the year, as they were bright enough to be seen in the day-time, when nearest the sun. He had not been long observing, before he perceived that the notion they had before entertained, that the stars were farthest north and south when the sun was near the equinoxes, was only true of those stars which are near the solstitial colure. And after continuing his observations a few months, he discovered what he then apprehended to be a general law observed by all the stars, namely, that each of them became stationary, or was farthest north or south, when it passed over his zenith at six of the clock, either in the evening or morning. He perceived also, that whatever situation the stars were in with respect to the cardinal points of the ecliptic, the apparent motion of every one of them tended the same way when they passed his instrument about the same hour of the day or night; for they all moved southward when they passed in the day, and northward when in the night: so that each of them was farthest north when it came in the evening about six of the clock, and farthest south when it came about six in the morning.\n",
      "Though he afterwards discovered that the maxima, in most of these stars, do not happen exactly when they pass at those hours; yet, not being able at that time to prove the contrary, and supposing that they did, he endeavoured to find out what proportion the greatest alterations of declination, in different stars, bore to each other; it being very evident that they did not all change their inclination equally. It has been before noticed, that it appeared from Mr Molineux’s observations, that y Draconis changed its declination above twice as much as the before-mentioned small star that was nearly opposite to it; but examining the matter more nicely, he found that the greatest change in the declination of these stars was as the sine of the latitude of each star respectively. This led him to suspect that there might be the like proportion between the maxima of other stars; but finding that the observations of some of them would not perfectly correspond with such an hypothesis, and not knowing whether the small difference he met with might not be owing to the uncertainty and error of the observations, he deferred the further examination into the truth of this hypothesis till he should be furnished with a series of observations made in all parts of the year; which would enable him not only to determine what errors the observations might be liable to, or how far they might safely be depended on, but also to judge whether there had ' been any sensible change in the parts of the instrument itself.\n",
      "When the year was completed, he began to examine and compare his observations; and having satisfied himself as to the general laws of the phenomena, he then endeavoured to find out the cause of them. He was already convinced that the apparent motion of the stars was not owing to a nutation of the earth’s axis. The next circumstance which occurred to him, was an alteration in the direction of the plumb-line, by which the instrument was constantly adjusted; but this, upon trial, proved insufficient. Then he considered what refraction might do; but here also he met with no satisfaction. At last, in a state of great perplexity, the discovery of Roemer occurred to him, that the motion of light, however incredibly swift, was not altogether instantaneous, but took a certain interval in passing from the sun to the earth; and then the truth flashed on his mind. He immediately perceived that the motion of the earth being also extremely rapid, might have though a small yet a perceptible relation to that of light, and might thus come by combining its influence to affect the direction of the visual rays, and with them the apparent situation of the stars, in the manner above explained. Pursuing this happy idea, he calculated the aberration from the relative velocities of the earth and of light, and comparing it with his own observations, was delighted to find them agree in every particular; so that no doubt could remain of the truth of his discovery.

      "Aberration of the Planets. This is quite of the same nature with that of the stars, only that its amount and direction are greatly affected by the motion of the planet itself combining itself with that of the earth, and producing on the whole a more complex result. When the planet is stationary, the aberration disappears altogether, because the light itself, participating of the motion of the planet, strikes the earth not only with its usual direct motion, but also with a lateral motion exactly the sáme as that of the earth itself. The eye of the spectator, therefore, and the light have the same motion laterally; and thus the effect is quite the same as if they had relatively no lateral motion at all. It is the same as if both the earth and the planet were at rest, and therefore there cannot be any aberration. In every other case, the aberration is determined by combining the motion of light not only with the earth’s, but with the planet’s motion also; and doing this it is found, that in every case the aberration is equal to the motion of the planet about the earth or its geocentric motion, during the interval that [7:2:35] light employs in passing from the planet to the earth. Thus, in the sun, the aberration in longitude is constantly 20\", that being the space moved by the sun, or, what is the same thing, by the earth, in 8' 7\", the time in which light passes from the sun to the earth. In like manner, knowing the distance of any planet from the earth, by proportion it will be, as the distance of the sun is to the distance of the planet, so is 8' 7\" to the time of light passing from the planet to the earth: then computing the planet’s geocentric motion in this time, that will be the aberration of the planet, whether it be in longitude, latitude, right ascension, or declination.\n",
      "Since the motion of the planets affects so much the aberration, ought not the motion of the fixed stars relatively to our system, if they have any, as some have suspected, be rendered sensible in this· manner? Their prodigious distance has hitherto rendered these motions, if they do exist, almost insensible. But this would not affect the motion of light. This element flics through the remotest parts of the system; and if it be really material, the motion with which it is propelled from one point must continue for ever afterwards to affect it, unless opposed or modified by extraneous influence. If the stars, therefore, have any motion laterally in respect of the earth, so will the light which issues from them, and which, preserving undiminished its original impulse, must strike the eye of a spectator on the earth not only with a direct motion, but also with one to the right or left similar to that of the star; and this ought to affect the aberration just in the same manner as if the star were no farther off than any of the planets. The same thing would be observed if the earth, along with the whole solar system, as the late Dr Herschel and other astronomers have attempted to prove, be advancing forward among the stars. Since, however, no such effect has ever been noticed, it would seem to follow, that the stars, as well as the sun, are really at rest; or if they have any motion, it is but a slow one, even compared with that of the earth or the planets round the sun. This is certainly a curious speculation, which we have never seen discussed by astronomers. See Astronomy. (c.)\n",
      "Aberration, in Optics, a certain deviation in the rays of light, from the true or geometrical focus of reflection or refraction in curved specula or lenses, arising from two causes, viz. 1$£, the figure of the speculum or lens, giving rise to what is called the spherical aberration; and, 2d, the unequal refrangibility of the rays of light giving rise, in lenses only however, to a far more material, and in other respects inconvenient aberration, termed the chromatic, or the aberration of colour, or of refrangibility. The object of all specula or lenses, is to collect the rays of light proceeding from any object into a single’ point, so as to form there a distinct image of the object, either enlarged or diminished, according as our purposes may require: and on this principle depends the whole operation of the telescope, the microscope, and other optical instruments. The more completely the rays can be collected into a focus, so much the more distinctly, in every case, does the image of the object appear at that point, and so much the more perfect is the operation of the instrument. But there are certain curves or figures in the speculum or lens, which are necessary to produce this effect. Parallel rays, for example, can only be collected into one focus by a reflecting speculum of a parabolic form, or by a refracting lens of parabolic or hyperbolic, combined with spherical curves: all other forms cause more or less a dispersion or aberration of the Tays from the focus. In practice, however, it is extremely difficult to form the lenses into these complex curves; and as the spherical form is much more easily constructed, and as the aberration from it is not generally attended with serious inconvenience, this form has been universally adopted. The amount of the aberration is measured either by the , distance longitudinally at which the rays meet from the true focus, or by the distance laterally by which they are dispersed from it. In all double convex lenses of equal spheres, the longitudinal aberration of the extreme ray is If of the thickness of the lens. The smallest aberration takes place when the radii of the spheres are as 1 to 6, the more convex surface being exposed to the rays; in that case, it is only 1-⅛th of the thickness of the lens. See Optics.\n",
      "The aberration of refrangib.ility is of far more importance. It arises from this circumstance, that in a homogeneous lens of glass the violet rays are greatly more refracted than the red. The latter are therefore thrown to a greater distance, and the others in proportion almost all deviating from the true focus: hence arises that confusion of images, and that fringe of extraneous colour with which objects are surrounded when seen through glasses of this description, which has ever formed the great obstacle to the perfection of the refracting telescope; so much so, that Sir Isaac Newton, misled at the time by a partial view of the subject, and others after him, were led to despair of success in correcting this defect, and thus directed their chief attention to those of the reflecting kind. Subsequent discoveries, however, led to the invention of achromatic glasses, by which the refracting telescope has been wonderfully improved; and some important experiments, we understand, are now going on at the Royal Institution in London, by Μ. Faraday, under the direction of the Board of Longitude, in the manufactμre of a more perfect glass than has hitherto been used, from which we may hope to see these instruments carried to a yet higher degree of perfection.

      "ABGAR, or Abgarus, a name given to several of the kings of Edessa in Syria. The most celebrated of them was one who, it is said, was contemporary with Jesus Christ; and who, having a distemper in his feet, and hearing of Jesus’s miraculous cures, requested him by letter to come and cure him. Eusebius,^[1. Hist. Eccl. lib. i. cap. 13.] who believed that this letter was genuine, and also an answer our Saviour is said to have returned to it, has translated them both from the Syriac, and asserts that they were taken out of the archives of the city of Edessa. The first is as follows :—“Abgarus, prince of Edessa, to Jesus the holy Saviour, who hath apeared in the flesh in the confines of Jerusalem, greeting.' have heard of thee, and of the cures thou hast wrought without medicines or herbs. For it is reported thou makest the blind to see, the lame to walk, lepers to be clean, devils and unclean spirits to be expelled, such as have been long diseased to be healed, and the dead to be raised; all which when I heard concerning thee, I concluded with myself, that either thou wast a God come down from heaven, or the Son of God sent to do these things. I have therefore written to thee, beseeching thee to vouchsafe to come unto me and cure my disease. For I have also heard that the Jews use thee ill, and lay snares to destroy thee. I have here a little city, pleasantly situated, and sufficient for us both. Abgarus.” To this letter Jesus, it is said, returned an answer by Ananias, Abgarus’s courier, which was as follows :— “Blessed art thou, 0 Abgarus! who hast believed in me whom thou hast not seen; for the Scriptures say of me, They who have seen me have not believed in me, that they who have not seen may, by believing, have life. But whereas thou writest to have me come to thee, it is of necessity that I fulfil all things here for which I am sent; and having finished them, to return to him that sent me: but when I am returned to him, I will then send one of my disciples to thee, who shall cure thy malady, and give life to thee and thine. Jesus.” After Jesus’s ascension, Judas, who is also named Thomas, sent Thaddeus, one of the seventy, to Abgarus; who preached the gospel to him and his people, cured him of his disorder, and wrought many other miracles: which was done, says Eusebius, a. d. 43.—Though the above letters are acknowledged to be spurious by the candid writers of the church of Rome, several Protestant authors, as Dr Parker, Dr Cave, and Dr Grabe, have maintained that they are genuine, and ought not to be rejected.\"\n",

Μ. Dobrizhoffer, who lived seven years in their country, informs us, in his account of them published in 1785, that they are not numerous, the whole nation not much exceeding 5000; for which he assigns as a reason an unnatural custom among their women of sometimes destroying their own children, from motives of jealousy lest their husbands should take other mates during the long time they give suck, which is not less than two years. They are naturally white, but, by exposure to the air and smoke, become of a brown colour. They are a strong and hardy race of people, which our author attributes to their marrying so late, an Abiponian seldom or never thinking of marriage till 30 years of age. They are greatly celebrated on account of their chastity and other virtues; though, according to our author, they have no knowledge of a Deity. They make frequent incursions into the territories of the Spaniards, mounted on the horses which run wild in those parts. They have a kind of order of chivalry for their warriors; and are so formidable, that 100 of their enemies will fly before ten of these horsemen. The hatred which these savages, whose manners, though rude and uncultivated, are in many respects pure and virtuous, bear to the Spaniards, is invincible. “These pretended Christians,” says our author, “who are the scum of the Spanish nation, practise every kind of fraud and villany among these poor barbarians; and their corrupt and vicious morals are so adapted to prejudice the Abiponians aĝainst the Christian religion, that the Jesuit missionaries have, by a severe law, prohibited any Spaniard from coming, without a formal permission, into any of their colonies.” From his account of the success of the Jesuits in converting them to Christianity, however, it does not appear that they have been able to do more than bribe them to a compliance with the ceremonies of the Popish superstition; so that in general they are quite ignorant and uncivilized; a most striking instance of which is, that in counting they can go no further than three; and all the art of the Jesuits to teach them the simplest use and expression of numbers has proved unsuccessful.

To which their opponents answer, that the Latins anciently had no ablative themselves, but instead thereof made use, like the Greeks, of the dative case; till at length they formed an ablative, governed by prepositions, which were not put before the dative: that, at first, the two cases had always the same termination, as they still have in many instances; but that this was afterwards changed in certain words.

Abolition was also used for expunging a person’s name from the public list of the accused, hung up in the treasury.

Critics and antiquaries are greatly divided as to the form, use, kinds, &c. of this garment. Papias makes it a species of the toga, or gown; but Nonnius, and most others, suppose it to be a species of the pallium, or cloak. The abolla seems rather to have stood opposed to the toga, which was a garment of peace, as the abolla was of war; at least Varro and Martial place them in this opposite light. There seem to have been different kinds of abollae, appropriated to different characters and occasions.

The term Aborigines, in modern geography, is applied to the primitive inhabitants of a country, in contradistinction to colonies, or new races of people.\n",
      "ABORTION, in Midwifery, the premature exclusion of a foetus. It has sometimes been doubted whether this unnatural practice was ranked as a crime in the laws of Greece and Rome. This question has been revived, and elaborately discussed in France, by some members of the Institute. The subject, it seems, had been incidentally alluded to in a discourse of Gregoire’s ’ upon the influence of Christianity on the condition of the female sex, read in the early part of 1814. This produced two dissertations, one by Μ. Clavier, and the other by Μ. Boissonade; the first maintaining the impunity of the practice among the ancients, the last, that it was on the contrary viewed as a penal offence.\n",
      "We find, says Μ. Clavier, that in one of Plato’s dialogues (Theaet.) Socrates is made to speak of artificial abortion, as a practice not only common, but allowable; and Plato himself authorizes it in his Pepublic, (lib. v.) Aristotle (Polit, lib. vii. c. 17) gives it as his opinion, that no child ought to be suffered to come into the world, the mother being above forty, or the father above fifty-five years of age. Lysias maintained, in one of his pleadings quoted by Harpocration, that forced abortion could not be considered homicide, because a child in utero was not an animal, or separate existence. Μ. Clavier admits, that, in a treatise ascribed to Galen, (An animal sit quod in utero est ?) there is mention made of enactments by Solon and Lycurgus against this crime; but he maintains that this is a spurious production, and that, at any rate, his testimony cannot be opposed to that of so many writers who lived long before his age. Among the Romans, Ovid (Amor. lib. ii.), Juvenal (Sat. vi. v. 594), and Seneca (Consol, ad Helv. 16), though they lament in strong terms the frequency of this enormity, yet they never allude to any laws by which it might be suppressed. Various other writers, it is said, preserve the same silence on this point, whilst joining in general reprobation of the crime.\n",
      "On the other hand, Μ. Boissonade appeals not only to the authority of Galen, but of Cicero, (Pro Cluentio,) as placing it beyond a doubt, that, so far from being allowed to pass with impunity, the offence in question was sometimes punished with death. With regard to the authority of Lysias, he states, that the pleading referred to is quoted by Harpocration himself as of dubious authenticity; and, as to Plato and Aristotle, he observes, that their speculative reasonings, in matters of legislation, ought not to be confounded with the actual state of the laws. And he adds, that Stobaeus (Sernι. 73) has preserved a passage from Musonius, in which that philosopher expressly states, that the ancient lawgivers inflicted punishments on females who caused themselves to abort.\n",
      "It seems indeed difficult to believe, that the practice in question should have been allowed to prevail without being denounced as criminal by the lawgivers of Greece and Rome; but it is not so clear that there was any law which [7:2:40] punished it with death. Tłrose readers who have any curiosity to enter more deeply into the inquiry, will be enabled to do so by consulting the various authorities to which Μ. Clavier and M. Boissonade have appealed, in support of their respective views of the question. The notorious frequency of the practice forms an odious feature in the manners of ancient times. Seneca makes it a ground of distinction for Helvia, that she had never, like others of her countrywomen, destroyed the child in her womb, in order to preserve her shape.\n",
      "By the law of England till lately, the only party held to be guilty of murder in forcingabor tion was the woman, when she was proved to have taken means to destroy a child quick in the womb, and actually to have thereby destroyed it. But in 1803, an act was passed, inflicting the punishment of death upon all concerned in administering any noxious substance with the intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman quick with child. The procuring or attempting it before the child has quickened, is punishable only with imprisonment or transportation. This law is evidently grounded upon a false hypothesis, that the foetus is not quick or alive till its motion in the womb becomes perceptible to the mother; and, what is of more importance, it makes no provision against the attempt to procure abortion by manual application. The reader will find a curious illustration of this defect, in a trial which occurred at the assizes held at Bury St Edmunds in 1808. See Trial of William Fizzy, &c. Ipswich, 1808.\n",
      "The case of John Fenton, tried at Perth in 1763, was the first instance of a criminal prosecution for this offence in Scotland; and here the public prosecutor restricted the libel to an arbitrary punishment. Our writers indeed agree, that, by the law of Scotland, the forcing of abortion is not homicide, whether the child be quick or not, except where the mother is killed in the process. Imprisonment or transportation may, and is all that can, in any case, be inflicted.\n",

It stands at the eastern extremity of the long neck of land between the sea and the lakes Mareotis and Maadie, upon which Alexandria, about twelve miles to the westward, is also situated. Eastward lies the spacious bay of Aboukir, reaching to the mouth of the Nile. This vicinity was the scene of some of the greatest events which distinguished the late war between Britain and France. In the bay of Aboukir, Nelson found the French fleet which had conveyed Buonaparte to Egypt, and instantly penetrating its line, gained that signal victory usually called the “Battle of the Nile,” in which the whole of the enemy’s fleet, with the exception of two vessels, were destroyed or captured. It was at Aboukir also that Sir Ralph Abercroraby, in 1801, effected his landing, and having driven the enemy up the sand hills, took possession of the place. In other respects Aboukir is not of much importance.\n",
      "ABOULFEDA, or Aγ>ulfeda, the most celebrated of the Arabian writers on history and geography. Among his contemporaries he was also distinguished both as a ruler and a warrior. His descent was in a direct line from Ayoub, father to Saladin, and from whom the house of that conqueror received the appellation of Ayoubites. Omar, the grandson of Ayoub, was one of Saladin’s most distinguished generals, and enjoyed the privilege, which he transmitted to his posterity, of being placed always on the right of the army. In reward of his services, he was created Prince of Hamah, the ancient Apamea, which, with some territories adjoining, became hereditary in his family. They were transmitted, in the course of succession, to Mahommed Mahmoud, and to Mahommed, the uncle ot Aboulfeda. Although none of these princes equalled the military glory of Omar, they were yet distinguished both in arms and letters. Continually engaged in military expeditions, their court was at the same time open to learned men. It is mentioned, among the proofs of their zeal for science, that Mahmoud caused to be constructed at Hamah, a gilded sphere of great magnitude, on which all the stars then known were represented.\n",
      "Aboulfeda was son to Ally, the brother of Mahommed. He was born at Damascus in the year 672 of the Hegira, (1273 a. D.) His early years were spent in the study of the Koran and of the sciences. By the age of twelve, however, he was summoned to the field, and was present at the attack of Marcab, a castle belonging to the knights of St John. Syria was then shaken by continual war, and thus scarcely a year elapsed, in which the young prince was not called out upon some military expedition. He successively assisted at the sieges of Tripoli, Acre, and Roum. In 1298, Prince Mahmoud, his cousin, who held the sovereignty, died, and left Aboulfeda heir. The succession, however, being violently disputed by his two brothers, the court, in consequeňce of their dissensions, took occasion to supersede all the three; and the Ayoubites lost the principality which they had enjoyed for more than a century. Aboulfeda, however, by his valour and other eminent qualities, soon recommended himself to the favour of the Sultan Melik-el-Nassir. He was present, and took an active part in the victory gained at Alkoroum in 1302, and in the still more signal one near Damascus in 1303, by which Syria was for the time delivered from the incursions of the Tartars. But peace was soon followed by internal dissensions. The throne of Egypt was disputed with Melik-el-Nassir by Bibars, who at first succeeded in obtaining possession of it. His rival, however, being supported by the great men of Syria, among whom Aboulfeda took a conspicuous part, finally triumphed. Λboulfeda, who had always stood well with Melik-el-Nassir, rose then into peculiar favour. The sultan took the first opportunity of establishing him in his patrimonial dignity of Prince of Hamah. Honours continued to shower upon him; he was invested with the distinctive marks of sovereignty, which consisted in the power of coining money, and in having prayers said in his name. The epithet Melik Moway∙ yad, victorious Prince, was conferred upon him; and it is stated by an Arabian author, that the sultan, in writing, addressed him by the appellation of brother.\n",
      "The rest of Aboulfeda’s life was spent in splendour and tranquillity, devoted to the government of his territory, and to the pursuits of science. Besides cultivating, he patronised literature; and his court became the rendezvous of all the learned men of the East. He conversed with them familiarly, bestowed upon them honours and pensions, and being himself superior to all in learning, felt no jealousy of their acquirements. During the same period he composed the works which have transmitted his name to posterity. In this enviable manner he spent the period of twenty years, when an illness, of which the particulars are not related, carried him off on the 26th October 1331. He was succeeded by his son Melik-el-Afdhal, of whom little is recorded, and who was the last Prince of Hamah.\n",
      "The two works by which Aboulfeda is known in Europe, are his Geography and his History. The former ranks at least equal to any composed upon that subject by the Arabian writers. It partakes indeed of their general defects; for, although he seems to have paid more attention to the latitudes and longitudes than the rest of his countrymen[7:2:41], yet the imperfect application of astronomy, and the obscurity of his notation, have much diminished the i value of this part of his labours. It is chiefly in the historical and descriptive parts that he can now be regarded as an authority. Here too his knowledge, as he himself candidly confesses, is chiefly confined to the circle of Moslem dominion; but within those limits, the information conveyed by him is undoubtedly valuable.\n",
      "His History possesses still higher claims to distinction. His method, as was usual with his countrymen, is entirely that of annals, and is in many parts too much abridged; but the work contains much valuable information with regard to the Saracen, and even to the Greek empire. It is divided into five parts, beginning at the creation of the world, and ending with the year 1328.\n",

Abrabanel passed for one of the most learned of the rabbis; and the Jews gave him the names of the Sage, the Prince, and the Great Politician. We have a commentary of his on all the Old Testament, which is pretty scarce: he there principally adheres to the literal sense; and his style is clear, but a little diffuse. His other works are, A Treatise on the Creation of the World; in which he refutes Aristotle, who imagined that the world was eternal: A Treatise on the Explication of the Prophecies relating to the Messiah, against the Christians: A book concerning Articles of Faith; and some others less sought after.

It is highly probable he was born in the city of Ur, in Chaldea, which he and his father left when they went to Canaan, where they remained till the death of Terah; after which, Abraham resumed his first design of going to Palestine. The Scriptures mention the several places he stopped at in Canaan; his journey into Egypt, where his wife was carried off from him; his going into Gerar, where Sarah was again taken from him, but restored as before; the victory he obtained over the four kings who had plundered Sodom; his compliance with his wife, who insisted that he should make use of their maid Hagar in order to raise up children; the covenant God made with him, sealed with the ceremony of circumcision; his obedience to the command of God, who ordered him to offer up his only son as a sacrifice, and how this bloody act was prevented; his marriage with Keturah; his death at the age of 175 years; and his interment in the cave of Machpelah, near the body of Sarah his first wife.\n",

As the number of students and readers diminished, authors neglected literature, and were disgusted with composition; for to write is seldom done, but when the writer entertains the hope of finding readers. Instead of original authors, there suddenly arose numbers of abridgers. These men, amidst the prevailing disgust for literature, imagined they should gratify the public by introducing a mode of reading works in a. few hours, which otherwise could not be done in many months; and observing that the bulky volumes of the ancients lay buried in dust, without any one condescending to examine them, the disagreeable necessity inspired them with an invention that might bring those works and themselves into public notice, by the care they took of renovating them. This they imagined to effect by forming abridgements of these ponderous volumes.\n",
      "“All the⅛g Abridgers, however, did not follow the same mode. Some contented themselves with making a mere abridgement of their authors, by employing their own expressions, or by inconsiderable alterations. Others composed those abridgements in drawing them from various authors, but from whose works they only took what appeared to them most worthy of observation, and dressed them in their own style. Others, again, having before them several authors who wrote on the same subject, took passages from each, united them, and thus formed a new work. They executed their design by digesting in common-places, and under various titles, the most valuable parts they could collect, from the best authors they read. To these last ingenious scholars we owe the rescue of many valuable fragments of antiquity. They happily preserved the best maxims, the characters of persons, descriptions, and many other subjects which they found interesting in their studies.\n",
      "[7:2:43]\n",
      "“There have been learned men who have censured these Abridgers, as the cause of our having lost so many , excellent entire works of the ancients; for posterity becoming less studious, was satisfied with these extracts, and neglected to preserve the originals, whose voluminous size was less attractive. Others on the contrary say, that these Abridgers have not been so prejudicial to literature as some have imagined; and that had it not been for their carc, which snatched many a perishable fragment from that shipwreck of letters which the barbarians occasioned, we should perhaps have had no works of the ancients remaining.\n",
      "“Abridgers, Compilers, and even Translators, in the present fastidious age, are alike regarded with contempt; yct to form their works with skill requires an exertion of judgment, and frequently of taste, of which their contemners appear to have no conception. It is the great misfortune of such literary labours, that even when performed with ability, the learned will not bc found to want them, and the unlearned have not discernment to appreciate them.” (D’Israeli’s Curiosities of Literature?)\n",

      "ABROGATION, the act of abolishing a law, by authority of the maker; in which sense the word is synonymous with abolition, repealing, and revocation.\n",
      "Abrogation stands opposed to rogation; it is distinguished from derogation, which implies the taking away only some part of a law; from subrogation, which denotes the adding a clause to it; from abrogation, which implies the limiting or restraining it; from dispensation, which only sets it aside in a particular instance; and from antiquation, which is the refusing to pass a law.\n",

      "ABRUZZO, one of the four provinces into which the continental part of the kingdom of Naples, or of the two Sicilies, was formerly divided, but now the name given to three out of the 17 provinces of the later division of that country. It is, with altered boundaries, now distinguished as Abruzzo Ulteriore First, Abruzzo Ulteriore Second, and Abruzzo Citeriore.\n",
      "Abruzzo Ulteriore First, is a maritime province on tlιe Adriatic Sea,»which is its boundary towards the northcast. On the north-west the Papal dominions bound it, on the south-east Abruzzo Citeriore, and on the southwest Abruzzo Ulteriore Second. The western part of the province is very mountainous; the highest crest of the Appcnines divides it from Abruzzo Ulteriore Second, and extends towards the sea. The district on the sea-coast is flat, but everywhere else hilly. The valleys between the hills possess a rich soil, well watered by rivulets and brooks in the winter and spring, but which are generally dried up in the summer months. These streams either run into the Pescara, which bounds the province towards Abruzzo Citeriore, or into the Tronto, which is the boundary on the Papal frontier. The extent of the province is 1140 square miles, or 730,600 English acres. The cultivation is badly conducted, and many districts are almost left in a state of natural wildness. The art of irrigation is not understood, nor embankment of the rivers practised, so that the best of the land is often rendered useless. There are owners of two or three hundred acres of land, who scarcely raise sufficient food for their families; and yet the soil, when tolerably managed, will yield 12 grains of wheat for one. The corn most cultivated and preferred is maize. Hemp and flax are raised, but, like corn, merely sufficient for the home supply. Olives, almonds, figs, grapes, and chesnuts, are abundant, as is wood for construction and fuel. The number of inhabitants is 157,339, according to the late census. They are a hardy, bold, idle, and superstitious, race. The most industrious of them stroll yearly into the territories of the Church to work at harvest and in making charcoal, and return home in winter with their wages. The province is divided into two districts, Teramo and Civita di Penne. The city of Teramo is the capital of the province.\n",
      "Abruzzo Ulteriore Second, a province in the continental division of the kingdom of Naples. It is an inland district, bounded on the north by the Papal States, on the north-east by Abruzzo Ulteriore First, on the south-east by Abruzzo Citeriore, on the south by the province Terra di Lavora, and on the west by the States of the Church, The extent is 2210 square miles, or 1,414,400 acres. The whole province is nearly covered with mountains of various heights, one of which, the Grand Casso ďltalia, near Aquila, is the loftiest peak of the Appenines. There are no plains; but among these mountains some beautiful and fruitful valleys have been formed by the various streams that run through them. None of the rivers are navigable, but all of them have abundance of water, except in the hottest of the summer months. The largest frcsh lake of the kingdom is that of Cellano, 14 miles long, and 9 broad, surrounded with hills. A canal, built by the Romans to carry off the surplus water, has been long neglected and stopped up, but is now in course of being cleaned and opened. The air is generally temperate, and the sirocco is never felt. The cultivation just suffices to provide sufficient corn for the inhabitants, who, when the maize is dear, make out thcir subsistence by the help of chesnuts. Olives and vines rarely bring their fruit to full ripeness. Some flax and hemp are raised, and a vast quantity of saffron, which is generally preferred to all other. The sheep produce fine wool when the flocks migrate,.and the flesh is good. The cows·, yield good butter and cheese, which form the chief articles of exportation to the neighbouring provinces. The inhabitants amount to 249,600. Like all mountaineers, they are a strong and active race, and frugal in their habits. The manufactures are insignificant, consisting of some little woollen and linen cloth, some paper, pottery, and wood-warc; but not sufficient of any for the demand of the territory, which is supplied by the exchange of almonds, figs, saffron, wool, butter, and cheese. The chief city is Aquila.\n",
      "Abruzzo Citeriore, a province in the kingdom of Naples. It is bounded on the north-west by Abruzzo Ulteriore First, on the north-east by the Adriatic Sea, on the south-west by the province Molise, and on the west by that of Abruzzo Ulteriore Second. This province is less hilly than the other two Abruzzos, but the Appenines are extended through the south-west part. They, however, gradually decline in height, and extend themselves in wide plains of sand and pebbles. The rivers [7:2:44] all run to the Adriatic, and are very deficient in water during the summer months. Agriculture is in a very backward state, and the soil is rather ungrateful when ' labour is bestowed upon it; and the inhabitants prefer the chase and the fishery to it. The corn is sufficient for the population, who grow and consume much more maize and rice than wheat or barley. On the coast some oil and some silk are produced, which, with wine, form the chief export articles. Hemp, flax, liquorice, almonds, and figs, are grown for home consumption. The cattle are more neglected than in the other Abruzzos, though there is excellent pasture both for sheep and cows. There are, however, abundance of swine, goats, and asses. The manufactures are very insignificant. All the exchange of commodities is carried on by land; for though the province has an extensive frontier to the sea, it has no harbour or secure anchoring places. The extent is 1920 square miles, or 1,228,800 acres. The inhabitants are 222,730. There is but one decent road through the province. The capital is Civita di Chieti, formerly called Teti.\n",
      "ABSALOM, in Scripture History, the son of David by Maacah, was brother to Tamar, David’s daughter, who was ravished by Amnon, their eldest brother by another mother. Absalom waited two years for an opportunity of revenging the injury done to his sister; and at last procured the assassination of Amnon at a feast which he had prepared for the king’s sons. He took refuge with Talmai, king of Geshur; and was no sooner restored to favour than he engaged the Israelites to revolt from his father. Absalom was defeated in the wood of Ephraim: as he was flying, his hair caught hold of an oak, where he hung till Joab came and thrust him through with three darts. David had expressly ordered his life to be spared, and extremely lamented him. The weight of Absalom’s hair, which is stated at “200 shekels after the king’s weight,” has occasioned much critical discussion. If, according to some, the Jewish shekel of silver was equal to half an ounce avoirdupois, 200 shekels would be 6½ pounds; or, according to Josephus, if the 200 shekels be equal to 5 minae, and each mina 2½ pounds, the weight of the hair would be 12½ pounds, a supposition not very credible. It has been supposed by others, that the shekel here denotes a weight in gold equal to the value of the silver shekel, or half an ounce, which will reduce the weight of the hair to about 5 ounces; or that the 200 shekels are meant to express the value, not the weight.\n",

Leontius himself was also an usurper. He had dethroned Justinian II. who afterwards, with the assistance of the Bulgarians, surprised and took Constantinople, and made Absimarus prisoner. Justinian, now settled on the throne, and having both Absimarus and Leontius in his power, loaded them with chains, ordered them to lie down on the ground, and with a barbarous pleasure held a foot on the neck of each for the space of an hour in presence of the people. They were beheaded A. d. 705. '\n",

      "ABSOLUTE, in a general sense, something that stands free or independent.\n",
      "Absolute is more particularly understood of a being or thing which does not proceed from any cause, or does not subsist by virtue of any other being, considered as its cause; in which sense God alone is absolute. Absolute, in this sense, is synonymous with independent, and stands opposed to dependent. Absolute also denotes a thing that is free from conditions or limitations; in which sense the word is synonymous with unconditional. We say, an absolute decree, absolute promise, absolute obedience.\n",

      "ABSOLUTE Equations, in Astronomy, is the aggregate of the optic and eccentric equations. The apparent inequality of a planet’s motion, arising from its not being equally distant from the earth at all times, is called its optic equation, and would subsist even if the planet’s real motion were uniform. The eccentric inequality is caused by the planet’s motion being uniform. To illustrate which, conceive the sun to move, or to appear to move, in the circumference of a circle, in whose centre the earth is placed. It is manifest, that if the sun moves uniformly in this circle, it must appear to move uniformly to a spectator on the earth; and in this case there will be no optic nor eccentric equation: but suppose the earth to be placed out of the centre of the circle, and then, though the sun’s motion should be really uniform, it would not appear to be so, when seen from the earth; and in this case there would be an optic equation, without an eccentric one. Imagine further, the sun’s orbit to be not circular but elliptic, and the earth in its focus; it will be as evident that the sun cannot appear to have an uniform motion in such ellipse: so that his motion will then be subject to two equations, the optic and the eccentric.\n",
      "ABSOLUTE Number, in Algebra, is any pure number standing in any equation without the conjunction of literal characters; as 2 x + 36 = 48; where 36 and 48 are absolute numbers, but 2 is not, as being joined with the letter x.\n",

      "ABSORBENTS, Or ABSORBING VβSSelS, in Anatomy, a name given promiscuously to the lacteal vessels, lymphatics, and inhalant arteries; a minute kind of vessels found in animal bodies, which imbibe fluids that come in contact with them. On account of their minuteness and transparency, they escape observation in ordinary dissection. They have, however, been detected in every tribe of animals, and, in the animals which have been examined, in every part of the body.\n",
      "ABSORPTION, in the animal economy, is the function of the absorbent vessels, or that power by which they take up and propel substances. This power has been ascribed to the operation of different causes, according to the theories which physiologists have proposed. Some attribute it to capillary attraction, others to the pressure of the atmosphere, and others to an ambiguous or unknown cause, which they denominate suction; for this last is nothing else than the elastic power of one part of the air restoring the equilibrium, which has been destroyed by the removal or rarefaction of another part.\n",
      "ABSORPTIONS of the Earth, a term used by Kircher and others for the sinking in of large tracts of land by means of subterranean commotions, and many other accidents.\n",
      "Pliny tells us, that in his time the mountain Cybotus, with the town of Curites, which stood on its side, were wholly absorbed into the earth, so that not the least trace of either remained; and he records the like fate of the city of Tantalis in Magnesia, and after it of the mountain Sipylus, both thus absorbed by a violent opening of the earth. Galanis and Gamales, towns once famous in Phoenicia, are recorded to have met the same fate; and the vast promontory called Phegium, in Ethiopia, after a violent earthquake in the night-time, was not to be seen in the morning, the whole having disappeared, and the earth closed over it. These and many other histories, attested by the authors of greatest credit among the ancients, abundantly prove the fact in the earlier ages; and there have not been wanting too many instances of more modern date. (Kircher’s Mund. Subter, p. 77.)\n",
      "Picus, a lofty mountain in one of the Molucca isles, which was seen at a great distance, and served as a landmark to sailors, was entirely destroyed by an earthquake; and its place is now occupied by a lake, the shores of which correspond exactly to the base of the mountain. In 1556, a similar accident happened in China. A whole province of the mountainous part of the country, with all the inhabitants, sunk in a moment, and was totally swallowed up: the space which was formerly land was also covered with an extensive lake of water. And, during the earthquakes which prevailed in the kingdom of Chili, in the year 1646, several whole mountains of the Andes sunk and disappeared.\n"

      "Self-Love is that instinctive principle which impels every animal, rational and irrational, to preserve its life and promote its own happiness. It is very generally confounded with selfishness; but we think that the one propensity is distinct from the other. Every man loves himself, but every man is not selfish. The selfish man grasps at all immediate advantages, regardless of the consequences which his conduct may have upon his neighbour. Self-love only prompts him who is actuated by it to procure to himself the greatest possible sum of happiness during the whole of his existence. In this pursuit the rational self-lover will often forego a present enjoyment to obtain a greater and more permanent one in reversion; and he will as often submit to a present pain to avoid a greater one hereafter. Self-love, as distinguished from selfishness, always comprehends the whole of a man's existence, and in that extended sense of the phrase, we hesitate not to say that every man is a self-lover; for, with eternity in his view, it is surely not possible for the most disinterested of the human race not to prefer himself to all other men, if their future and everlasting interests could come into competition. This indeed they can never do; for though the introduction of evil into the world, and the different ranks which it makes necessary in society, put it in the power of a man to raise himself, in the present state, by the depression of his neighbour or by the practice of injustice, yet in the pursuit of a prize which is to be gained only by soberness, righteousness, and piety, there can be no rivalship among the different competitors. The success of one is no injury to another; and, therefore, in this sense of the phrase, self-love is not only lawful, but absolutely unavoidable. It has been a question in morals, whether it be not likewise the incentive to every action, however virtuous or apparently disinterested?\n",

      "Serpent, in Mythology, was a common symbol of the sun, and he is represented biting his tail, and with his body formed into a circle, in order to indicate the ordinary course of this luminary. The serpent was also the symbol of Medicine, and of the gods which presided over it, as of Apollo and Aesculapius; and this animal was the object of very ancient and general worship, under various appellations and characters. In most of the ancient rites we find some allusion to the serpent, under the several titles of Ob, Ops, Python, and the like. This idolatry is alluded to by Moses. The woman at Endor who had a familiar spirit is called Oub, or Ob, which is interpreted Pythonissa. The place where she resided, says Bryant, seems to have been named from the worship there instituted; for Endor is compounded of En-adοr, and signifies fons Pythonis, “the fountain of light,” the oracle of the god Ador, which oracle was probably founded by the Canaanites, and had never been totally suppressed. His pillar was also called Abbadir or Abadir, compounded of ab and adir, and meaning the serpent deity Addir, the same as Adorns.\n",

He was educated at Cambridge, and in 1667 entered into orders. The same year he became domestic chaplain to Sir Heneage Finch, then attorney-general. In 1672 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Berkshire. In 1675 he was installed a prebendary in the cathedral church of Norwich; and the year following was instituted into the rectory of St Bartholomew, near the Royal Exchange, London. In 1681 he was, by the interest of his patron Sir Heneage Finch, then lord high chancellor of England, made dean of Norwich, but in 1686 was suspended for taking occasion, in some of his sermons, to vindicate the doctrine of the Church of England in opposition to Popery. In 1688 he was sworn chaplain to James II. being then probably restored after his suspension j for it is certain that he was chaplain to Charles II. and attended as a court chaplain at the coronation of James II. In 1689 he was declared dean of Canterbury, but never could be persuaded to fill up any of the vacancies made by the deprived bishops. Upon the death of Dr Lamplugh, he was promoted to the see of York. In 1702 he preached the sermon at the coronation of Queen Anne; and the same year he was sworn of the privy council, and made lord almoner to her majesty. He died at Bath in 1713, and was interred in the cathedral of York, where a monument was erected to his memory. His sermons were collected after his death, and published in seven vols. 8vo.\n",

      "Sheridan, Mrs. Frances, wife of Thomas Sheridan, A. M. was born in Ireland about the year 1724, but descended from a good English family which had removed thither. Her maiden name was Chamberlaine, and she was granddaughter of Sir Oliver Chamberlaine. The first literary performance by which she distinguished herself, was a little pamphlet at the time of a violent party-dispute relative to the theatre, in which Mr Sheridan had newly embarked his fortune. So well-timed a work exciting the attention of Mr Sheridan, he by an accident discovered his fair patroness, to whom he was soon afterwards married. She was a person of the most amiable character in every relation of life, with the most engaging manners. After lingering some years in a very weak state of health, she died at Blois, in the south of France, in the year 1767. Her Sidney Bid-dulph may be ranked with the first productions of that class in ours or in any other language. She also wrote a little romance, in one volume, called Nourjahad, in which there is a great deal of imagination, productive of an admirable moral. She was likewise the authoress of two comedies, The Discovery, and The Dupe.\n",

      "Tatta, an ancient and celebrated city, and capital of the above district, situated near the banks of the Indus, about 130 miles by the course of the river from the sea. It was formerly a rich and commercial city, but is now greatly decayed, exhibiting, instead of the bustle and animation of its ancient trade, long streets of ruinous and uninhabited houses. The situation is in a valley formed by a range of low rocky hills, which, during the freshes of the Indus, is inundated; but being placed on an eminence, apparently formed by ancient ruins, Tatta has the appearance of an island when the adjacent flat is inundated by the rains. The streets are narrow and dirty; but the houses are superior to the low huts commonly seen in native towns. They are built on a peculiar plan. The walls are made hollow by [7:21:92] small pieces of sticks, from eight to sixteen inches long, being nailed across each other, from the outer edges of a small frame of wood. They are placed diagonally, and thus form a strong frame on both sides, which is plastered over with mud or mortar, and afterwards has the appearance of a solid wall. They are frequently four stories high, with heavy flat roofs. Many of the better sort are built with brick and mortar on a frame of timber; and all, from the governor’s house to the lowest hovel, have a sort of ventilators like chimneys, down which the wind blows cool and refreshing in the most sultry weather; at which time every aperture is shut to exclude the hot wind and the dust. The old English factory purchased by the company in 1751 still remains, and may be reckoned the best house in the place. To the southward, within the town, are the remains of an old fort.\n",

      "Temperament of the Musical Scale. “In the modern system, called tempered,” says a German writer on music, “all the intervals are not employed in their original perfection, as the nature of the harmonic scale presents them, but lose, sometimes in this interval, sometimes in that other, something of their acuteness or gravity. In fact, experience shows that, in tuning the major and minor thirds, the fifths, and the fourths, in their original perfection, when we reach a certain term, we meet with a fault of too great excess or too great deficiency; and from this faultiness arises the necessity of tempering this or that sound, in order to combine reciprocally the intervals of one mode with those of another, the result of which is called temperament.\" The nature and the principle of temperament, as applied to musical instruments of fixed sounds, may be understood by perusing pp. 610, 611, of vol. xv., article Music , and p. 533 of vol. xvi., article Organ. We shall here content ourselves with giving a very few additional remarks, and with indicating some works whence further information may be derived, seeing that the subject of musical temperament is not of sufficient importance to occupy much room in a work like this. The various systems of temperament that have been proposed for such instruments as the organ, the harpsichord, the piano-forte, &c. offer only a choice in the distribution of the imperfections of false intonation. The unequal temperament is that usually adopted; but it must be observed, that tuners in general proceed more by rule of routine and an indifferent ear, than according to any scientific principle of temperament. Hence the great differences found among instruments tuned by different tuners. It is a common error to suppose that “a person who sings in tune, tempers without lmowing it.” Even Chladni, following the lead, has asserted this; while the truth is, that there is no temperament in the voice of a singer whose intonation is perfect, unless his voice and ear happen to be misguided by the accompaniment of a tempered instrument, that is, an instrument out of tune. When left to itself, the voice of such a singer, in executing the most intricate modulations, forms the sounds in their true ratios to the different tonics or key-notes that occur, and, in the wonderful subtlety of the intonations of that only perfect musical instrument, the human voice, possesses all the intonations that are necessary to form these sounds exactly. Nearly the same thing occurs in the case of such a violin-player as a Viotti or a Paganini when he plays alone, and undisturbed by the false intonations of any accompanying instrument. This was actually proved in Paris about thirty years ago, by the experiments made by M. Charles and the celebrated violinist Viotti. We may here remark, that it [7:21:174] is of great detriment to the just intonation of a singer, to learn to sing by the guidance of an instrument such as the piano-forte, as is the common practice; for a habit of malintonation is then inevitably acquired. The same remark applies to singers taught with the accompaniment of those instruments with fretted finger-boards, such as the guitar, of which the intonation is also imperfect. As to the imperfections of the common guitar, the reader may consult the lively and ingenious work entitled Instructions to my Daughter, for playing on the Enharmonic Guitar, London, 1829. The celebrated singer Madame Mara used to say that every singer ought to learn to play the violin, in order to acquire a knowledge of just intonation. Certainly that instrument, and others of the violin kind, are the only ones we have that are capable of the nearest approach to perfect intonation, making allowances for the mechanical imperfections of their strings, as we have already hinted in the article Music . But still the human voice is the only perfect musical instrument. It has been a prevalent opinion among musicians and writers upon music, that the ancient Greeks were ignorant of many of our musical intervals, and possessed no instruments capable of executing our modern musical scales. But it is more than probable that the knowledge of the ratios of musical intervals, and of perfect intonation in a variety of scales, was much more exact among the ancient Indians, Arabians, and Greeks, than is generally supposed, or than the scanty, imperfect, and corrupted Greek relics of works on music, and the very limited examination of Indian and Arabian manuscripts, have hitherto been able to show. The reader may consult, on the subject of musical temperament, the following works. Among these, one of the best is Professor Robison’s, for clearness, as well as useful suggestions.

      "Temple, Templum, a public building erected in honour of some deity, either true or false; and in which the people meet for the purpose of religious worship. The word is formed from the Latin templum, which some derive from the Greek τέμενος , signifying the same thing. The word templum, in its primary sense among the old Romans, signified nothing more than a place set apart and consecrated by the augurs, whether enclosed or open, in the city or in the fields. Clemens Alexandrinus and Eusebius refer the origin of temples to the sepulchres built for the dead. This notion has been illustrated and confirmed by a variety of testimonies by Mr Farmer in his Treatise on the Worship of Human Spirits, p. 373, &c. Herodotus and Strabo represent the Egyptians as the first who built temples to the gods. The first erected in Greece is ascribed to Deucalion, by Apollonius, Argonaut, lib. iii. Some ancient people performed their sacrifices in all places indifferently, from a persuasion that the whole world is the temple of God, and that he required no other. This was the doctrine of the magi, followed by the Persians, the Scythians, the Numidians, and many other nations mentioned by Herodotus, lib. i., Strabo, lib. xv,, and Cicero in his second oration against Verres. The Persians, who worshipped the sun, believed it would wrong his power to enclose him within the [7:21:178] walls of a temple, who had the whole world for his habitation; and hence, when Xerxes ravaged Greece, the magi exhorted him to destroy all the temples he met with. The Sicyonians would build no temple to their goddess Coronis; nor the Athenians, for the like reason, erect any statue to Clemency, who, they said, was to live in the hearts of men, not within stone walls. The Bithynians had no temples but the mountains; nor had the ancient Germans any other but the woods. Even some philosophers have blamed the use and building of temples, particularly Diogenes, Zeno, and his followers the Stoics. But it may be said, that if God has no need of temples, men have need of places to meet in for the public offices of religion; and accordingly temples may be traced back even into the remotest antiquity. See Hospinian De Origine Templorum.\n",

      "Teniers, David, the younger, also an admirable painter, was the son of the former, and was born at Antwerp in 1610. He obtained the name of Ape of Painting, from his imitating the manner of different painters with such exactness as to deceive even the nicest judges. He greatly improved under his father, and obtained such reputation as introduced him to the favour of the great. The archduke Leopold William made him gentleman of his bed-chamber; and all the pictures of his gallery were copied by Teniers, and engraved by his direction. The king of Spain and Don Juan of Austria set so high a value on his pictures, that they built a gallery to receive them. William prince of Orange honoured him with his friendship; and Rubens not only esteemed his works, but assisted him with his advice. His principal talent lay in landscapes adorned with small figures. He also painted men drinking and smoking, chemists’ laboratories, country fairs, and the like. His small figures are superior to his large ones. He died in 1694. Abraham, another son of the elder David Teniers, was equal, if not superior, to his father and brother in the expression of his characters, and his understanding the chiaroscuro; though he was inferior in the sprightliness of his touch, and the lightness of his pencil.\n",

      "Teutonic Order, an order of military knights, established towards the close of the twelfth century, on the following occasion. When the emperor Barbarossa engaged in a crusade for the recovery of the Holy Land out of the bonds of Saladin, he was followed by great numbers of German volunteers, who from various motives enlisted under his banners. After the emperor’s death, the Germans, who had signalized themselves before Acre or Ptolemais, resolved to choose another leader; and at last fixed their choice upon Frederick duke of Suabia, second son to the emperor, and Henry duke of Brabant. Under these generals they behaved with so much bravery, that Henry king of Jerusalem, the patriarch, and several other princes, determined to reward their valour by instituting an order of knighthood in their favour. This was accordingly done, and the new knights had at first the title of the knights of St George; afterwards it was thought proper to place them under the tutelage of the Virgin Mary, to whom there was already an hospital dedicated on Mount Zion, for the relief of German pilgrims. From this time they were called Equites Mariani, or knights of St Mary. Laws, regulations, and statutes, were drawn up for them by the Christian kings in Syria and the patriarch; and, among other obligations, it was required, that every person admitted to the privileges of the order should be of noble parentage; that the order should defend the Christian religion and the Holy Land; that they should exercise hospitality towards the Christians in general, but particularly those of their own country; and that they should with all their power endeavour to propagate and extend the Christian faith. In the year 1190, having become rich by donations from the superstitious, they elected as their first grandmaster Henry Walpot, a German, who hail distinguished himself by his zeal and valour; and their choice was confirmed by the emperor. The following year, Pope Celestine III. confirmed their privileges already granted, giving them the title of the Teutonic knights of the Hospital of St Mary the Virgin. By the conditions of this bull, they vowed perpetual continence, obedience, and poverty; obligations to which it may well be imagined they did not very strictly adhere.\n",
